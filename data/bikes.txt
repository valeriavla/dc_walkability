might want to repost on rbikedc for a different side of opinions
honestly the city as a whole has become very bike friendly theres many protected bike routes in all  quadrants for trails you have the mbt metropolitan branch trail art anacostia riverwalk trail cct capital crescent trail rcpt rock creek park trail co canal that all act as major paved arteries protected lanes you have th st sw th st swth st nw etc and then the mvt custis and wod in virginia many many more it isnt until you get way up into nw or across the anacostia that the bike infra drops off but even that is getting better year over yeardefinitely check out and follow rbikedc we regularly give route recommendations and trail conditions for utilitarian riders over there
if you work downtown theres a protected bike lane up th st until euclid st so neighborhoods like logan circle u st dupont east even columbia heights could work west end could work too since theres a protected eastwest route on l and m sts
heres a bike map from ddothttpsddotdcgovpagebicyclemaps heres a list of mapsresources from wabahttpswabaorgresourcesmapsanddocuments
are you planning to bike to work for utility errands etc exercisemight help narrow it down
woodley park can hit rock creek park which is a protected bike lane or ride towards adams morgan in the bike lane on calvert st also there is a plan to put a protected bike lane on connecticut ave which goes through woodley park also woodley park is on the metro red line and it has a lot of nice rent controlled buildings
dc as a whole is pretty bike friendly its the maryland drivers you need to keep an eye on noma has the mbt which is pretty great
as a regular cyclist overall the city is fairly bikeable there arent many pure bike lanededicated neighborhoods per se youre more likely to find that in order to get from ab your route may be influenced by the presence of bike lanesthat being said living near the mbt in brookland has been very commutable columbia heights has a bike lane updown th there are a smattering downtownif you go to google maps you can turn on the bike lane view and really take a look at the options
dupont  logan circle downtown all good areas
capitol hill has some really nice bike lanes plus its just pretty cute while h street itself is terrible for bikes a block north or south have decent protected lanes plus its much less hilly than much of nw
live as close to the national mall rock creek park or the mbt as you canthese all have good connections to dedicated lanes and also within walking distance of metro and a grocery store
i think it really depends what neighbourhood you end up working in or where you plan to be spending most time away from home in dc eg if youre commuting to capitol hill living close to the metropolitan branch trail is going to give you a far more pleasant cycling experience than living in nw dupontadmo etc if youre working in nw or bethesda or wherever thats going to be a different set of considerations ime the bike routes running northsouth are a lot better more protected less stop and start than the bike routes running eastwest
i would recommend a neighborhood south of florida ave unless youve got an ebike or have shredded calves biking up the hills to get to columbia heights or petworth sucks sometimes
lots of dc is super bikeable just know that bike theft is rampant so plan accordingly maybe get an absolute beater to start
ooh thanks for the suggestion
honestly the city as a whole has become very bike friendlyby us standards there are still major gaps in the cycling network unfortunately
the murderous drivers somehow still manage to make it unfriendly
fyi op th street has a very steep hill from w to euclidsteep enough that a lotta people bike downhill using bikeshare and take a bus back uphill
id like to use a bike as a major form of transportation for everything  going to work running errands general exercise meeting up with friends etc ill most likely be working remotely for the first few months of my job in dc so i wont need it for commuting initially but may eventually
until that time conn ave is super dangerous avoid plus much uphill
im assuming mbt  metropolitan branch trail i didnt realize this was a thing this will definitely factor into my neighborhood choice as i was initially mostly considering nw dc neighborhoods
to be fair lot of dc has the mbt it officially goes up through brookland soon ft totten and will eventually link silver spring to union stationnomambtadjacent neighborhoods currently include noma eckington edgewood brookland and arguablysoon michigan park per google maps im not going to open up an argument about which of the aforementioned is actually a real neighborhoodanyway the mbt is quite nice for riding my pet peeve is that there are too many people on electric bikes that are both fast and careless however the doubleedged sword is that its also very popular with walkers and joggers they slow down the electric bikes but also the manual ones i dont find it much of a nuisance since people are pretty good about staying to the right but once in a while
the mbt is amazing i find the th bike lane really unsafe as there are constantly drivers esp food delivery  taxis parked in it pulling in and out of it etc
the bike lanes on g and i streets are not protected its just paint on the ground
th st at meridian hill is well protected but yeah you will be huffing and puffing trying to climb it on a regular bike
yeah thats it
i live in noma right next to the trail and its great for biking down to union station or up further north
my favorite trail in the city quite flat minimal vehicle crossings great breweries and bars along it close to the red line in case weather changes or my plans do and i want to get home quickly
join us in brookland
it is a good trail to get you from eckington yards edgewood brookland or even brentwood to downtown quickly  it has gotten more of the electric conveyances of late too many of the people who use those things on trails are even worse than spandex boys are on streetsi even will use it to go to nationals park although it stops near where the coal yards used to be near the new york ave subway stop  from there i simply go to first street which has bicycle lanes to the station  from the station there are several ways to get to the ball parkgenerally people do stay to the right regardless of what they are using  if you ding your bell they will give a little more to the rightthe navy yardballparksouthwest area is not bad for bicycles either  it is mostly flat or close to it  if you are coming down new jersey ave off capitol hillthough do make sure that you have good brakes as there is a steady stream of jaywalkeruhpedestrians that cross at the intersection with i st  sethe bicycle paths in rock creek park are pretty good  i wish that more people would use themwoodley park is pretty good  if you are trying to get to it from dupont though there is a really nasty hill on connecticut ave  if you ride a few blocks west from dupont to rock creek park the gradient on the cathedral avenue ramp is  milder but longerthe streets in both old and new downtown have bicycle lanes but do look out for trucks and the motorists who are making turns from the one way streets  the turn lane crosses the bicycle lane at one point and no one motorist or bicyclist seems to be looking for the other  trucks do like to park in those lanes   uberlyft drivers also are there waiting for the typical passenger who typically is not aware of his surroundings or just does not care thus takes his sweet time coming out of the addressdc do es make many accommodations for bicycle riders  it aint quite minneapolisst paul but it might get there one day
is there any word on when it will be finished through fort totten
worse thing on the mbt is the occasional vespa andor motorcycle i wish i was kidding
i get really annoyed with guys on a long fast ride who use the mbt for part of it who get annoyed at pedestrians get out of town if you want a long ride dont try to set a pr on a pedestrian artery
there are two awkward points for the mbt the first is at the dewdrop inn where it kinda ends for a bit until you get to monroe the second is the end of the mbt around the noma station is a little chaotic i thought they were going to build something to link it up better to union station
if you believe the ddot march  i havent seen it so cant vouch for ithttpsddotcpmetbranchtrdcgishubarcgiscom
are you trying to trigger me if so well done kidding of course anything gaspowered on the mbt grinds my gears especially on days like today one of the first nice days of the year so everyone is out and about
cops patrol on their big bikes theyre going like  mph and i assume its to deter other gas powered vehicles a bike might struggle to catch the  wheelers ive seen on there but theres not a ton of room for them same for dpr trucks and gators you see on there toothe main drag of the mbt is part of my running route so im on there  times a week ive seen the rare atv and dirt bike on there rare those rental mopeds though the slightly bigger ones are distressingly common they should be geoblocked there if possible
couldnt you make the counterargument that there are even more sidewalks than bike lanes so pedestrians should stick to walking on the sidewalks its specifically for pedestrians and bicycleshttpsddotcpmetbranchtrdcgishubarcgiscom so not a pedestrian arteryim not advocating for mph pelotons to ride the mbt but i think youre being a little heavy handed
there is a protected bike lane to union from noma fuckwads still find a way to block it though
there are two supposed southern termini for the mbt  one is at the new york avenue subway where you have the switchback ramp  you can ride in one of the bicycle lanes to first st then south to the station  as the commenter remarks often there is a truck blocking it or an uberlyft driver awaiting a customer who is taking his sweet time emerging  you also will see the occasional fubar cheats or floor trash driver who blocks itthe other terminus is at l st  you ride past the switchback ramp through a gap in the fence that is paved and come to a stair  i have carried my bicycle up or down that stair more than once  mind you i am carrying a  reissue of a  schwinn heavyweight three speed not a carbonaluminum ultra lightweight mountain bicycleyou can do it but like you i do wish that there were a neater connexion to either first st or the stationif i recall correctly and now you are going to make me look the next time that i go by there there are sharrows on eighth st past the dewdrop inn then you get bicycle lanes on monroe st  there actually is supposed to be a path constructed that will take you up either puerto rico ave or mc cormack drive i forget which side of the tracks now  so far it has been only talktalk and vapourware  at some point it is supposed to go to silver spring and link with the capital crescent trail to create a bicycle beltway if you will  in reality the path of the latter is also a bit chaotic once you leave the point where the old georgetown branch switched off the metropolitan sub near forest glen station to head into silver spring
watch them test the signals for another year and a half

any news on where the new stations will be
 bikes for  million thats over  per bike
now if they could only do a better job of moving the bikes around there are hardly any bikes by my house in the morning and the rack is usually full when i get home i know that there are commuting directions and i am just not getting to them early enough but its frustrating  end rant 
deleted
i wish they would offer helmets with the bikes as well 
i got some of my best exercise in this winter  also it gives you a little lee way to get to work late nobody questions that person that road through the snow for showing up  minutes late
dear god please give ivy city a station  i dont live there but it would give me a reason to visit the new businesses cropping up there
does that include the stations too maybe includes cost of rebalancing too  all i know is that somehow cabi is very affordable yr i think the tourists who pay day supplement the costs for the residents here 
id like to think its a poorly worded sentence the district is buying most of the bicycles   bikes for  stations at a cost of  millionlooks like instead of for they should of used and 
the government pays hundreds for hammers and such as well anything the government pays for is more than a private company would pay
i wonder if one could somehow incentivize people to return to empty stations the velib system in paris gives people  minutes of bonus time for future trips above  minutes when you take it from a regular station to a  station a  station is usually at the top of a hill and tend to be emptier as the day goes on
you might do well to figure out their rebalancing schedule they usually hit the ones by me around the same time on weekdays if delaying your commute by  minutes could get you a bike it might be worthwhile
the rebalancing part is tough  this may be an obvious suggestion but the cabi app is really good in that it lets you see how many bikesdocks are available at all the stations near your location 
yeah i think they adjusted their rebalancing strategy around the time they began operating the fulltime corrals completely full and empty docks have definitely been a more frequent occurrence the past few months  more so than previous summers theres a cool map someone put together using the api that graphs historical dock and bike availability check it out herehttpbikesoobriencomwashingtondczoomlonlat not ideal for mobile but theres already apps for that 
yeah who would have thought that pg county would ever wind up making shortsighted transportation planning decisions
that is a shame that pgc is not part of cabi because the ride from college park to dc via the anacostia tributary trail system is actually really nice
nyc may have been quicker to identify and adopt a different bike manufacturer i was there this past weekend and all of the newer bikes were a little different from the rest like those we have here if cabi go with the new manufacturer your seat height will be a little different and the gear shifter goes in the opposite direction 
how would that work logistically  different head sizes different hygiene levels it seems like an enormous mess to even think about 
when you sign up for a membership i think they offer you a helmet
removed
the hechts warehouse where moms is among other things is slated for a station it is part of the commitment made as a condition of the development
that reminds me of the rock climbing barcoffee house thing coming soon there so many businesses in one place
no idea i just thought it was crazy expensive not saying that capital bike share isnt affordable for the individual just think theyre possibly overpaying for bikes p 
the tourist rate is crazy high in paris you pay about that much for a week rather than a day which is why ive never used it do many visitors to the city pony up the dough
they raised it to  this year still not bad and pays for itself after a few months of regular usage
thats interesting i would like to see how we could implement that here a study would need to be done to find out which station generally lack bikes compared to the demand maybe some way for people to notify that they arrived at a station wanting a bike but found it empty although i could see a button being totally exploited by idiots just pressing it a million times skewing the results 
oh thats a great idea i wouldnt mind taking a few block detour for the credit
they do have this or at least they used to members who rode bikes from typically full stations to typically empty ones were rewarded although i think it was just a summer program they should bring it back and allow people to rack up free ride credit for rebalancing or something similar
theres been times where theres no bikes within a halfmile radius of my apartment 
for those unaware the commuter corrals mentioned are   i and   nyhttpswwwcapitalbikesharecomnewsannouncingmorningcorralservicethe ny ave one is a couple blocks out of the way but when i do commute on cabi its well worth it to take the small diversion and know i can drop the bike right off
i mean it would reduce head injuries and death ive had a concussion and its not fun itd be for the good of public health 
yep i just signed up a month or so ago and i think the helmet offer was something like  for a helmet  i would have got one but my dome is so big that the one size fits all isnt quite big enough  
good point i rode this winter without snow tires its doable but not recommended
that sounds awesome do you have any links to news about it or anything
the annual paris pass is also only  but many of the bikes are in horrible condition
you could possibly look at the rate of how quickly stations fill or empty at different times of day a simple way might just be to reward people who park their bike somewhere with less than  bikes remaining crowdsourcing rebalancing 
 a study would need to be done to find out which station generally lack bikes compared to the demandi think cabi already has data on this just by the fact that they are doing the manual rebalancing 
it doesnt have to be that complicated look at the speed at which bikes were being checked out up until the moment when there were zero bikes left then you can extrapolate the demand at least well enough for comparing to other stations
i was at one of their open houses a number of months back when someone asked about this their response was that they found it mostly rewarded people who would have made that trip anyways but that they are continuing to look for new ways to deal with rebalancing issues
i would love if they could implement pickup corrals in different neighborhoods during week days the columbia heights bikes all run out by like am they cant guarantee unlimited bikes but a truck with a few dozen would really help meet demand 
they do sell helmets and some local stores offer discounts with a key but i agree that they should probably do more to promote helmet wearing
httpwwwwashingtonpostcomnewslocalwpnewdcgymwillbringbeerandrockclimbingunderoneroof
as a regular velib user i rarely have a problem finding a good bike once in a while theres only a rundown buttbuster but its rare
i heard the former dc secretary of transportation that implemented cabi gabe klein say that in paris people rent the bikes and throw them into the river as a protest against the bourgeoisie not sure if thats true or relevant but i thought it was funny
it definitely gets ridiculous when theres zero bikes within a halfmile or more of where youre starting 
thanks
depends on the part of the city  on the hills of the e  e its hard for me to find any bike at all
at one point they were stolen quite often but i doubt it had anything to do with a protest
yeah my commute by bike would be  minutes but in order to get a bike i need to leave over an hour before work begins not super sensical  
its true in hilly areas fortunately where i stay its quite flat so people are happy to ride in both directions
yeah for me in the morning i liked cruising half a mile on one to the metro when thered be a bike available i usually go in around  am so its worth it since it can mean the difference between just catching one train or just missing it and waiting  minutes for the next one but no way is it worth it if id first have to walk nearly half a mile in the wrong direction to get a bike 
done thanks for posting
why yes i do live in checks options somerset
oh so only one person died i would say that six or seven more people should be sacrificed before i consider being inconvenienced by a few minutes lets get those lanes back people  average wealthy motorist
 do you think its fair that montgomery county took away a car lane to build a parkwho wrote this a  yr old child if fairness was really the concern i think we need to start redistributing expensive chevy chase homes to those less fortunate

anywhere within a couple miles of core downtown noma navy yard gtown capitol hill adams morgan the wharf sw waterfront chinatown dupont circle i could go on but you could honestly name same near every neighborhood in dc outside of far nw and east of the anacostia river but even those two are getting better year over yearthe citys bike infra is built out to the point now that theres not very many places you cant get to by bike path if you dont want to a lot of those being dedicated trails or protected bike lanes and the city also just recently committed to adding a minimum of  miles of protected bike infra per year to add to their risk adverse rider bike network
capitol hill seems to have the least amount of car traffic and most bike lanes agree that is hard to go wrong as long as youre near a metro station somewhere in dcalso if you are planning on using capital bike share which is a pretty good deal you should be aware that bikedock availability is dicey in many nw dc areas dc gets very hilly in nw so it seems to me that many will bike downhill but dont make the return trip navy yard capitol hill and sw dc seem to always have pretty good availability for bikeshare id guess its because they are relatively flatter so people bike pretty evenly in the area
if you are biking for exercise or leisure you may want to live near some of the off street trails like the metropolitan branch trail mbt which stretches from union station to fort totten or the anacostia river trail art which has good connections near navy yard like others have said the bike infrastructure is decent throughout most parts of the city if you were commuting there are definitely better routes to take over others so that would be specific on where you are working check out google maps with biking selected to see the network it is generally pretty accurate
hey theres a lot of good advice here one thing id recommend is looking up bike maps like this one which i saved on my phone as a reference whenever i bike someplace newer httpsddotdcgovpagebicyclemapsechoing what others have said the city core sw waterfront and east of the capitol from florida ave on south tend to be pretty bikeable and those latter areas i mentioned are low on commuter car traffic usually up north things get sparser but there are bike corridors along th st you can take safely all the way to takoma metro and of course the mbtareas to avoid or be cautious about when it comes to bikeability southeast is really lacking compared to west of the anacostia northwest west of rock creek park is hilly the big avenues connecticut mass wisc id plan on not biking unless its downhill but ive done all those during weekend levels of trafficthe capital crescent trail once you get on it in georgetown doesnt connect to anything else until youre well into md so dont plan on that as a bikeable shortcutalso to be wary crossing new york ave once east of florida ave technically you can at the circle with wv ave but its a mess of traffic and so many cyclists have been struck there sd ave ri ave and bladenburg rd are not bikeable so you have to rely on side streets and it can be really hilly
i know some others have pointed to the current bike maps but ill also point you to the ddot map for currentupcoming pbl builds through fyhttpsddotdcgovsitesdefaultfilesdcsitesddotpagecontentattachmentscccpblmapvpdf this will give you an idea of which neighborhoods will also see the biggest expansion of pbls over the next couple of years my understanding is all of the lanes on this map have dedicated funding sources so they will happencurrently live in noma and the northern connection via mbt is great and will fully connect to silver spring and the northern trails in the next couple of years as well as protected connections down to the mall and many other trails around the district
hijacking this thread because im moving to arlington in the summer and have a similar question how is the bike infrastructure across the river does anyone know which arlington neighborhoods would be the most bike friendly
depends on what kind of housing youre looking for apts than nomaunion market districtnavy yard if row houseenglish basement than capitol hill ive lived in nese for over a decade and bike everywhere much safer than in nw bc more car traffic and generally more relaxed vibe
keep putting in complaints on the bikeshare app when you encounter empty stations in nw they need enough complaints that they cant ignore it and start redistributing bikes up the hill
but in caphill are they protected bike lanes 
arlington is actually an amazing city for biking
the arlington loop is fantastic httpswwwbikearlingtoncomthearlingtonloopacommunitygem
thats good to hear are there good paved bike trailslanes in ballston or calrendon
the custis trail will take you to the wod and that will take you many more places
just looked it up and it seems pretty awesome excited to try it out this summer
just get ready for those hills on the custis
nick is a well known nut job frequently harasses bikers in the street been banned from nextdoor multiple times etc
haha i love this you know us cyclists love cole slaw so we have been driving up the cost at any store near us
pro tip dont try to make sense of this there is noneedit this is this guyhttpstwittercommrwedekindstatus if so now this makes sense
what a lunaticeveryone knows higher prices are caused by manbearpig
hearusnow is nicks personal neighborhood megaphone its basically an echo chamber he was once anc in b and along with his friend and former fellow commish ed hanlon have been fighting the th street thing for years the above screen cap is comedy gold
this is simultaneously the funniest and stupidest thing ive read today
that coleslaw used to be  in let me guess ward 
its a bad sign that i saw  nick and immediately knew who this was
i mean if the stores customers primarily drove cars to the store and if the protected bike lane removed parking availability and if it was easy for driving customers to switch to an alternative store so revenue for the affected store dropped and if the store sold inelastic goods and if the store was locally owned and had control of pricing thenthere would be a mechanism for the bike lane to cause higher prices highly implausible and this guy seems a little out there but i wouldnt dismiss the guy as stupid id just ask for proof of all the conditionals abovepls dont downvote me to hell
just make the coleslaw yourself it will be so much cheaper
oh wow i thought this was a joke email not some real life nut job asking real questions
wait is this delledonne good god the man needs to get a hobby
oh do we think this is the nick i didnt notice the name in the signature lol
thought this was that nick unsurprised the video of him yelling in front of pre schoolers is a real gem
yeah thats the safeway on th
haha thanks for posting i have this clip saved and go to it everytime i need a laugh  
 man  bear  pig
ed hanlon also sues his neighbors for petty stuff oh and dont forget bike lanes are worse than the  riots
no its the one in dupont th nw ward 
hyper local inflation caused by a bike lane visible on precisely one consumer goods price but no others its more likely than you think
nope  this guy is on record as saying connecticut avenue was destroyed by bike lanes and all the businesses closed and has his own civic association that yells at anc commissioners about the pbl on th
this is his hobby
i was wondering if this was him when i say saw this on ig
yup theres where i shop too i was wondering why cheese prices went up  all you cyclists can go to hell
no one was talking to you uvisionzero
its an albany expression
heres to praying nick gets the help he needs or a kick in the ass
they have a surprisingly nice cheese selection
your coleslaw is not the topic of conversation here
you wouldnt say it in utica
as long as theyre not cheese wheels those remind me too much of protected bike lanes i faint in the aisle
the chinaman is not the issue here dude
i would not pick a neighborhood based on this since almost any bike ride of meaningful distance involves leaving the neighborhood
capitol hill fairly close to the city center and good bike lanes and easy access to the anacostia trail network
mt pleasant hands down great access to downtown cross town and georgetown via bike lanes also next to rock creek the starting point for most good road rides in the city
deleted
mount pleasant or eckington or admo
im aware of all the hills and lack of bike lanes on connecticut ave but im going with woodley parkcleveland park tried my best to stay in the area and ive had luck connecticut ave can be chaotic especially near the zoo but having klingle trail less than half a mile away is super nice
depends on where you need to get to i like capitol hill up to brookland myselfie the east side of town because it feels less crowded with cars and there are a lot of bike lanes but i also work on this side of town and am happy to hang here biking to nw has gotten better since they added a protected east  west lane by cu
most of the city is ok for biking but bike lanes are popping up all the time in the city i would think any walkable neighborhood would also end up being good for biking if you have an ebike you dont have to worry about the hills please join rbikedc for input on where to live and where is good for cycling in the area we have lots of offroad biking trails that will actually get you to different neighborhoods and destinations
silver spring i started on my bike late morning meandered thru rock creek park trails and am now on co towpath ill take metro back home my two nonnegotiables when i was moving this spring were  balcony and  near bike trails downtown silver spring ticked both boxes
what do you mean by how good biking is in that neighborhood most bike rides would extend well beyond a single neighborhood so we need to know more about what kind of biking you want to doare you looking to toodle around the neighborhood with your toddler on their balance bike are you looking to be close to the pathtrail network do you want to be close to designated mountain biking trails are you looking for a safe commute to a specific office site do you want to be within walking distance of multiple bike shops
it does not get much better than arlandria on the arlingtonalexandria line  where the birchmere is if youre familiar with that venue right off the four mile run and mt vernon trails easy access through four mile run park or the potomac yard trail additionally even the busy streets in the area are bikefriendly and youre right across the th st bridge or roosevelt from the district
solely based on biking trails and nothing else arlington  but taking into account any other considerations id pick my current neighborhood in dc arlington would be bottom of the list
rosslyn
potomac yard alexandria va dupont area dc
i chose to live in mt pleasant bc i find it charming and bc if the access to rcp which is my favorite area to ride
any other cities that arent sfseattlenyc that are built like ours to be somewhat bikefriendly yes i know bike lane opponents here suck ha
i moved to southwest so that i could live directly on the anacostia river trail i need to cross something like two roads to get to georgetown or rosslyn  points beyond one for alexandria and one to get up to the east side of the anacostia the mall is walking distance and the mbt is just on the other side i rarely do hains loops but if i did its a stones throw awaythe one downside is having to deal with downtown traffic to get across town to stuff in nw but tbh the green line tunnel is an adequate bypass until that marvelous day when the eastern downtown cycletrack happensi wouldnt be as happy if i had to rely on rock creek loud crowded bumpy blind intersections or mbt hot incomplete abrupt end in noma or the street gridhttpsggwashorgviewdchasmorestoplightsthanitspeercities every time i left the house
its not dc but the absolute best place to live i found for biking was near old town alexandria easy access to mt vernon trail going either way four mile run gravelly point biking to arlington cemetery or into dc to see the monuments and lots of food options to bike to
i disagree strongly i would pick a fairly flat neighborhood probably not at higher elevation surrounded by good bike infrastructure to accomplish exactly what you state leaving the neighborhood
 cross town and georgetown via bike lanessincere question which lanes are you talking about crosstown i would have guessed would be irving to the big new protected lanes then mbt but thats not all lanes east of warderish on irving and to georgetown i just dont know columbia to 
i second west end also easy access to co canal capital crescent and mt vernon
tell me more because i was genuinely thinking not eckington or adams morgan  what am i missing
same im right by the zoo and can either take klingle or porter st for easy access to rock creek its great
 please join rbikedc youre here now lol
it was really just a hypothetical not personally tailored for me just what you thought
im in roslyn and really like being close to georgetown
funny two out of the three times ive been hit by a car in the bike lane were in rosslyn and im a resident of dc
there is no neighborhood in this city that is not reasonably accessible by bike infrastructure and if youre so averse to hills that youd pick a neighborhood to avoid them especially in a city where even the steepest hills are pretty mild you probably dont belong on a bike
so eckington is really envious trail access and near location to multiple areas  want to ride the art or other east side trails  hop down to the mbt and up to brookland and out michigan ave to pick up the be branch trailwant to get to silver spring hop on mbt and head north welcome to silgo creekwant to get to the national mall  quick hop down mbt dumps you at the capitol buildingconnect to co  ride through the mall want to get to rock creek  mbt up to park and cut across to the rock creek entrance on tildenheaded to work downtown  r st bike lane to th and donemost of these routes are downhills or flat leaving eckington  the mbt is a clutch connector trailfor admo its tony nw but right before the big elevation gain to the cleveland park or van ness or more northern areas  you cross the bridge to hit the west side trails of rock creek  or you ride a couple blocks over to get to th  as long as you work downtown that is all straight down hill on way thereboth of those allow you to bike commute at a leisure pace even in the summer earlier in the day around  and not have to shower at work eckington way more affordable and quiet than admo  but if you want all the restaurants and nightlife cant go wrong with admomount pleasant is a good mix but less affordable these days
omg sorry i thought that i was in the regular dc subreddit lol
i was disoriented for a minute
i just meant for trail access
most of upper nw within  blocks of md line and much of eotr lacks cycling infrastructurealso gatekeeping much not everyone interested in cycling is in great shape
its all good thanks for spreading the word  op made their original post here and crossposted it to rwashingtondc  which is another great way to help people find our sub 
then i definitely agree with you
i have a tern hsd i love it and i have velosurancei wouldnt buy one unless i had a way to store it inside at home and work i will ulock and chain when doing groceries or riding to my kayak launchif you do go this route definitely suggest abus keyed alike locks it makes such a difference only needing one key
i would get an ebike if you can secure it at both ends of your commute take the lane when cycling
check with your homeowners or renters insurance it may cover a bike against theft even if the bike is stolen while out and about most ebikes are probably going to exceed the value that will be covered without a specific policy though so i would definitely look into a separate policy because the likelihood of theft if you dont have a secure place to store it at home and work is pretty highas for crashes well you can do your best to be safe but you cant  eliminate risk especially when drivers are definitely not doing their best if youre not comfortable riding in the city or even if you just think you could stand to learn more waba runs a city cycling class in the spring and fall i havent taken it but have heard good things the fall sessions dont seem to be listed yet but should be any day now at httpswabaorgcitycyclinghttpswabaorgcitycycling
as long as you have a secure place to store it overnight you should be fine imo this means a garage backyard shed or physically in your house  locking it to a pole outside your house would likely end up stolen i park mine in my buildings garagefor trips out into the city you should be fine with a good chain and u lock the longer youre going to be away from it the more protection you want thoughfor instance if im going to columbia heights or chinatown for a long time i lock up with my main beefy chain lock through the rear wheel and frame u lock through the center frame cable lock through front tire secured to u lock frame lockcafe lock immobilizes rear wheel chain attached to framecafe locki also have an alarm that goes off is someone tries to move the bikeusually though if im just shopping for a short amount of time or am nearby i just lock up with my chain lock the lock i use is this which is what the lockpickinglawyer uses on his personal bikekryptonite evolution mini integrated mm chain bicycle lock httpswwwamazoncomdpbqnmirefcmswrapaibsshjkdjpbwgcfeencodingutfpsci also have velosurance which adds a lot of peace of mind for me ive had my bike for about a year now and have had no theft attemptswhen it comes to commuting in the city especially the lenfant city an ebike is great most roads are  mph which is how fast an ebike can go so you can safely take the lane some drivers will still get angry but you need to do what is safest for you avoid major high speed arterials and get if the sidewalk if you cant avoid themon google maps there is an overlay that shows bike lanes in dc its not perfect but it helps a lot i would definitely recommend taking a more circuitous route that has good bike lanes over a shorter one with bad lanes over time you will memorize which streets you feel best oni think thats all the advice i have welcome to the party
i wouldnt leave it outside overnight regardless of the lock you use  i wont even leave my dollar bike out all night because angle grinders during the day if you lock it to a bike rack or traffic sign like a no parking sign i wouldnt worry about it just my 
i dont own one but i have seen people hide airtags inside them in case they get stolen then report them to police for recovery
always take the lane plus most dc neighborhood streets are  mph now  youll be at the speed limit
thanks for the responseso when you say likelihood of theft if you dont have a secure place is pretty high is that even with a rigid u locki have a secure place at both home and work but i am still concerned that there will definitely be times where i would have to secure it to a busy public bike rack with a rigid u lock i dont want to severely limit my usage when its my primary mode of transport in the city
thanks so much for the detailed responsethis is all very helpful
best thing to do is a u lock and a cable or chain lock  having both makes it a higher effort theft target as many thieves only carry one type of cutter and are opportunisticbut i recommend getting a capital bikeshare subscription less than  bucks a year and using that for shorter trips when you are doing things like dinner or movie or whatever  use the ebike when you can lock it up well andof for short times only
you can lock it up for brief periods i do it all the time i would just choose your racks well
yeah lock it up with a good ulock and carry the battery with you if it is easily removed but if you leave it locked up in a public place for long enough its a lot higher risk basically live your life take appropriate precautions and be prepared for anything you lock up to get stolen because all locks are just temporary deterrents against a determined bike thiefedit and definitely make sure youre locking it properly i recently saw a bike courier lock his bike to a sturdy looking rack by putting his ulock around the fork below the head tube that would take literally seconds for any halfway competent thief to steal
awesome thanks
thanks understoodi wont use the head or seat tubes but both the top and down tubes are okay to use for locking though rightand yeah if im headed somewhere for a long duration i would just use the metro
its pretty nice actually most of the northsouth car traffic is on west patrick henry and washington now that they pedestrianized that stretch of king st union st is way more relaxed a bunch of the intersections are fourway stops too so cars rarely go fast off the main throughways
yeah royal st is a defacto northsouth bike boulevard  the west end is abysmal for biking but old town rides better than it looks
considering the amount of side and neighborhood streets in old town there is never a need to ride on the main roads such as rt
there are so many intersections that cars never really get a chance to go fast but neither will you youll be fine
i ride in old town a lot its a good place to live as a cyclist a lot of stopstart on the main roads even if you do an idaho stop but i take royal union and prince frequently i feel pretty safe there taking basic precautionsbeing aware of surroundings
its easy  not particularly fast and one must have basic urban cycling skills  lights and visible clothing highly recommended  i find the mt vernon trail ns of alexandria much more dangerous  more road room in old town
i moved here and get around a lot by bike we have had a rough time of it with antibike people google seminary rd in alexandria and it burned our best staff plus chronic underfunding if you move here and want to help change that look us up httpsalexandriabpacwordpresscom
thank you
unless your destination is on a main road
i am all for a bike lane on mi love the water street bike lane but its pretty out of the way for many of my destinations
the bike route through georgetown is one block up on n street
i commute to georgetown on m every day and i almost always turn left at th and take the bike lane on water street its out of the way and only a few blocks long but to me feels safer than the alternative
if im going to va id much rather take the roosevelt bridge and risk falling into the water than go through m st though sometimes i also dont mind going through the georgetown waterfront then taking the stairs right by key bridge  they have little ramps for your bikes
m is bad but for my money canal between m and macarthur  foxhall is much worse neither the road nor the sidewalk is safe the annoying thing about it is that ddot were planning to rehab the trolley trestle and build a new bridge across the front of gu to connect to prospect st but the gu admin shut it down behind the scenes simply because they didnt like the look of the bridge it should be a major scandal but it wont until some pedestrian or cyclist has to die because the gu administration didnt like the look of a bridge
there is a bike route along the canal
would be amazing if they could do that
its always been a death trap and not designed for cyclists  i would say its where many riders have earned their stripes of learning what to watch for around drivers one of the safest ways on that street toward key bride is to not ride the curbparked lane but the right side of the passing lane traffic tends to be slow on m if that is too intense n street is a good alternative and that is the street that should get the bike lane designation l similar to how ddot set up g and i street to bracket h
it is on the map for eventually buildout but that may be decades and decades away also reservoir and macarthur have planned bikewayslink httpsmovedcdcgovpagesbicycles
is the water street bike lane under the bridge if so its such a headache transferring from m to there on my way home
thats a good route to get by some parts of m street but it dead ends before gu and you need to get down on m to get anywhere westsouth some of the hills down there are dangerously steep to descend into traffic haha
agreed that that bike lane is a much safer option especially for going to the cct but with the hill and one ways roads it can be tough to get back up to m
how do you get back up the hill
yup
its safer but that bike lane is still hell on the weekends with the cars pedestrians and the ice cream trucks i went out on the wod trail last weekend via key bridge and saw they are looking to construct some sort of path up to m soon
me i have an ebike
youre definitely not wrong it feels like a game of paperboy most of the time im looking forward to seeing what kind of connection they are working on
 a collection of sensible ways to get aroundso probably not what youre looking for then but ive been trying to keep openstreetmaporg uptodate when new bikelanes are addedthe nice thing about openstreetmap is anybody can use the data you put there  if you make an improvement literally thousands of websites will pull that improvement in and millions of users will indirectly get your new data  for instance ive been putting that data over here on my website  httpscyclemapus  my color choices there are  green  paved brown  unpavedif you want sensible ways to get around openstreetmap has another concept called a local cycle networkhttpswikiopenstreetmaporgwikitagnetworkdlcn which is more than just a place you can ride but a networked link of places you can ride decided by whoever puts up the literal biking signs on our streets  less formally relationshttpswikiopenstreetmaporgwikirelationroute let you mark a bunch of things together as a cycling route but still require the routes to be real and verifiable as defined by a publisher
nice start your map skews heavily to the nw in current detail i bike most of my time in ne and the anacostia tributary trail system through prince georges and could help here here are some things that jumped out at me from my experience   all of the anacostia trail routes should be on the map in the same manner as the capital crescent trail   the trolley trail between hyattsville and college park is a crucial utilitarian trail connection along route  that needs to be here in the same manner as the capital crescent trail   for nontrail routes i think you also need a good flat route over the brookland bump between the mbt and mount rainierroute  corridor heres the admittedly complicated route i use heading northbound starting at th and monroe ne turn left on th street ne turn right on randolph street ne turn left on th street ne turn right on ritchie place ne turn left on th street ne turn right on taylor street ne turn left on th street ne then turn right on varnum street ne it is zigzaggy but those turns flatten the brookland hills considerably conceptually it just sticks to the streetgrid on the southeastern side of michigan avenue    alternatives to benning road ne are crucial for lowstress rides to the anacostia trails and kingman park headed eastbound is easier  i follow gales street ne to st street ne to e street ne to oklahoma avenue westbound is more complicated due to oneway streets and irregular street grid  i string together a stillshifting mix of alleys and streets to head westbound while avoiding benning    despite the incline martin luther king jr avenue se and its bus lanes are probably the best way to bike into st elizabeths and the more southern parts of southeast
nice ideai moved here from chicago and your map reminded me of the mellow chicago bike map httpschicagoreadercomnewspoliticsthemellowchicagobikemapourguidetotheloweststressroutesinthecityits hard to define what constitutes a street people feel comfortable riding on its very contextdependent and itll vary a lot by the individual but its always great to see people putting in the work to map out their own preferred routes to help share the local knowledge with others
g st ne has an eastbound bike lane from nd st ne to maryland ne
the strava heat map is also a great place to get info about how often a route is cycled though that heavily favors roadies it also might be paywalled now 
east capitol st has bike lanes in both directions from the capitol to lincoln park and unofficially everyone rides through the capitol grounds to reach pennsylvania ave from east capitol its much safer than constitution or independence
just noticed that you have u street marked as a westbound route from vermont to florida im betting you meant to mark v street instead
unpopular opinion but i find google maps bicycle lanes pretty up to date and accurate  of the streets i ride on are marked on google maps
the city really needs to fix this commuting dead zone theres no good options once you run out of bike lanes around mt vernon square httpsiimgurcomihgeyjpg
thanks for making this you saved me from a dangerous spot ive been commuting through for the past year cant wait to try the new route tomorrow morn
thanks uarichnad this will certainly help in my endeavor  i certainly want to have all the bike lanes on there in addition to other sensible routes  is this map embeddable on any of the map apps  i have bikemap which uses opencyclemap but i dont see how i could upload your edits to see when riding  also i really wish these and the official dc maps marked single direction routes in some way that is discernable at a glancethats really why im mapping it all out  plus its a pretty zen activity
excellent feedback  ill work on it it is nw focused as thats where i know best ill get these edits on in the next couple days
got them thanks
that said both g and i ne in that stretch are comfortable rides either direction
thanks ill get this in
could you describe the route you take on the capitol grounds eastbound and westbound from pennsylvania to east capitol do you use northwest or southwest dr
yep i meant v thanks
not unpopular but the idea is to include unofficial but imo optimal routes to connect the various regions of the city plenty on this map that isnt on google maps cycling
agree
great how did it go
you can export the osm data and import it to your map easily enough let me know if you want help i can pull it real quick and send you the kml files
 i have bikemap which uses opencyclemapok then you already have it  opencyclemap is openstreetmap so everything i put into openstreetmap will already show up thereit doesnt seem to be updated though  bikemap has some terribly old data  i dont see the bikelanes on th st nw or g st nw or virginia ave etc etc  and opencyclemaps own website isnt showing sharedbuscycleways on h and i streetsas for how to embed data from one map to another thats usually dependent on which map youre using  i like to use geojson files and kml files and gpx files to get small amounts of data between maps because those formats are fairly open and can be used on almost any map  but getting the data into those formats isnt always easy
sure westbound id go from east capitol cross first st then go straight toward the capitol building along the plaza then bear right north to reach the small road labeled northwest dr on google maps that empties out at a small traffic circle with the peace monument in it eastbound i use the path just south of northwest dr because the road is one way its a very wide path and on a steep upward hill so youre going slow and theres no problem sharing with pedestrians
i mean fortunately the biking infrastructure from columbia heights and south is reasonably good and that inner core is where i mostly cycle  other then georgetown theres never anywhere west of rock creek park that im ridingalso just as a substantive criticism of your map  your map doesnt seem to be taking into account hills one reason i dont ride nw of rcp or in mt pleasant which you have an image for is that the hills are way too steep
felt a lot safer
thanks ill add it
the beauty of dc is that all areas have good access to trails and good routes that said for a road cyclist id say the closer you are to beach dr the better
imo the best pure road riding nearest dc is in the montgomery county agricultural reserve the roads are quiet scenic and moderately hilly living along the western leg of the red line of metro will give you access to some of those roads whether by car or bike youll still be able to use the rock creek valley and the cct that way as well a bonus about moco is that the county has a bicycle master plan and money committed for its implementation
lowertraffic roads or trailsplenty of trails in the area none of which are particularly low traffic though most are pretty full in the evenings and weekends locals use the hell out of recreation here thats not to say its bad just something youll have to get used topretty much any neighborhood along the potomac river in va or dc is recreation heaven and has good access to public transit and downtown dc tends to have a little more nightlife restaurant scene than virginia imo but both sides have their pluses and minuses virginia neighborhoods would be pentagon city potomac yard rosslyn dc would be georgetown foggy bottom district wharf navy yard lots more but thats a start either side you have a large community of local bike shops and group rides to choose from if you like that potomac pedalers is pretty active i would avoid anywhere in md if you want to bike commute to k st as it would be a trek from anywhere decently urban like silver spring montgomery county
in montgomery county live anywhere within a few miles of rock creek park and youre golden i live in rockville near olney and i can ride from my house to downtown dc without ever spending time riding on major roads crossing a few thoughtheres also a bunch of great if short singletrack and wooded rides too its a wonderful place to ride bikes
anywhere within a few miles of the wod trail will get you access to that and connections to the trails nearer to dc
rosslyn
maryland thoughts sligo creek trail is pretty great for cycling and hooks up with the anacostia trail  south of takoma park it is less crowded and north of takoma park it is fine to cycle on the road you can go from wheaton to navy yard without riding on a road if you want river road and beach drive are generally the known cycling roads  capital crescent is too busy for bike training rock creek trail is great for riding but i probably wouldnt do high intensity training on it co canal trail is also good for riding dirtfine gravel but it is busy south of great fallsmontgomery county and dc also close some streets to car traffic on weekendsgenerally the bike infrastructure is much better than many us citiessuburbs but there are gaps in between routes
i live in silver spring less than half a mile from rock creek park and beach drive large parts of which are closed to traffic there are also many paved trails that parallel or shoot off from bd last week i rode down bd to the co towpath then to the capital crescent across bethesda back through the park and home for a nice mile ride if you have the app alltrails you can see bike trails in the area and decide which trails you want to live near there are many
arlington between rosslyn  ballston  access to all the great cycling wod custis mt vernon rock creek and cap crescent and running trails to k st with several metro stops  although it is across the river the co canal towpath is a runners paradise restaurants bars etc you will pay a small fortune for housing but you get used to it
too major things to optimize for closeness to hains point basically the only semiuninterrupted loop miles where you can put in training miles closeness to the west side of the city this means access to rock creek park it also almost more importantly means access to macarthur blvd which you can take to potomac and the ag reserve further up which are some of the chillest and best riding roads in the entire region based on these two factors that would point to somewhere like foggy bottom the most expensive zip code in dc another slightly less expensive options would downtown adams morgan dupont area
the mt vernon trail is one of the great ones to live by as it connects to so many other bike trails and goes past multiple bridges into dc httpbikewashingtonorgtrailsvernonthere is a map on there check it out give you an idea of where you could live by it with easy access into dc
or anywhere along the wod east of e falls church metro or the custis trail
never biked out there looks real nice
httpspreviewredditqlxpiqydtqajpegwidthformatpjpgautowebpvenabledsafafeaaaebdcaceai took this picture yesterday of all the construction workers parked on the sidewalk next to the atworth apartments at college park metro
some lady and her husband chased me with their truck and suv because she was driving in the bike lane behind me and i gave her a piece of my mind he caused me to crash as i was running from him ogr bike lanes are a joke those bollards dont prevent idiocy
i swear there is no more entitled driver out there than a landscaping truck
httpspreviewredditwcxwvrwyqapngwidthformatpjpgautowebpvenabledsdcdfddfcbedaeeafdefeffth st last week 
how much of an idiot are you if you refuse to go around
a shame the county wasted all that time to make a carcentric bike lane that makes all turns a shit show then reduce the speed limit and paint imaginary lines and ofc folks antagonize cyclists for using  the motherfuckin bike lane
those things are just vertical paint to drivers
sorry to hear of course and hope youre alright
rwoosh
this i am so sick of defending those bike lanes to the world yes bikes deserve space when the actual lanes are so stupidly done dont actually solve the problem and cause other problems
exactly then it leads to this awful cycle tehe of low traffic in the bike lanes bc no one wants to die commuters who absolutely need it are the ones who face the bullshit and death and people in cars feel slighted by the perceived waste of space engineering tax dollars at work share the road
yes and we hear over and over that we dont need the bike lanes because no one is using them it almost feels like they are designed to fail
