Might want to repost on r/bikedc for a different side of opinions,I probably wouldn't be living in the area if it wasn't for metro.,"I’ve had different favorites as I’ve aged. When I was young, and first moved here, I loved U street and Adams Morgan. Then I became fond of H street. Now that I’m old, and no longer care about nightlife, I am a big fan of Georgetown, Kalorama, and Glover Park."
"Honestly the city as a whole has become very bike friendly. There's many protected bike routes in all 4 quadrants. For trails you have the MBT (Metropolitan Branch Trail, ART (Anacostia Riverwalk Trail), CCT (Capital Crescent Trail), RCPT (Rock Creek Park Trail), C&O Canal that all act as major paved arteries. Protected lanes you have 4th St SW, 17th St SW/15th St NW, etc. And then the MVT, Custis, and WO&D in Virginia. Many many more. It isn't until you get way up into NW or across the Anacostia that the bike infra drops off. But even that is getting better year over year.

Definitely check out and follow r/bikedc. We regularly give route recommendations and trail conditions for utilitarian riders over there.","I didn't even bring my car when I moved to the area, I can't even imagine what it would be like without the metro.","Mt. Pleasant. You go there/live there and you go, really? This place actually exists in the nation’s capital? No way!"
"If you work downtown, there’s a protected bike lane up 15th st until Euclid st. So neighborhoods like Logan circle, U st, Dupont East, even Columbia Heights could work. West end could work too since there’s a protected east/west route on L and M Sts","I don't own a car. If not for the Metro (and MetroBus), I'd be driving almost daily. Even more likely, I wouldn't be living in DC as decent public transportation was toward the top of my list when deciding to move to a new city.",I'm surprised no one has said Capitol Hill
"[Here’s a bike map from DDOT](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/bicycle-maps). 

[Here’s a list of maps/resources from WABA](https://waba.org/resources/maps-and-documents/).",My bike is a bigger reason my car is mostly a lawn ornament but metrorail/metrobus do replace at least a few car trips per week.,"Mt. Pleasant.

&#x200B;

I always said if I could buy property anywhere in the city it would be in Mt. Pleasant. There have consistently been like 5-6 of my favorite bars/restaurants within walking distance for as long as I've lived in DC (30+ years), and it's quiet, and it's out of the way, and it abuts Rock Creek Park, and I can catch a bus/train to almost anywhere in the city I would ever want to go."
"Are you planning to bike to work? For utility (errands etc.)? Exercise?
Might help narrow it down.","For me, it's not so much that I'm driving less but that I'm going to things that I just wouldn't do if driving (and then paying for parking!) were the only option. Especially now that I'm WFH, there's no way I'd go to evening events downtown without the bus/train. I'd probably go to the Nats once per year vs 10-15. We'd also need to be a two car household instead of one.

So it's a mix of saving money and opening up the city for me. Plus spending more money in ways that stay in the community vs sending it out to multinational companies via higher oil/gas consumption and buying more cars.","I love Adams Morgan. There’s something for everyone. Great food from all over the world. Top notch cocktail bars, stand up comedy, live music and dancing, a michelin starred restaurant, tennis courts, basketball courts, a soccer field, multiple parks, plenty of night life for the early-mid 20s crowd, a short walk away from beautiful kalorama, and low crime relative to a lot of other neighborhoods."
Woodley park. Can hit rock creek park which is a protected bike lane or ride towards adams Morgan in the bike lane on Calvert St. Also there is a plan to put a protected bike lane on Connecticut Ave which goes through Woodley park. Also Woodley park is on the metro red line. And it has a lot of nice rent controlled buildings.,"I use metro literally every single day. On the other hand, my car sometimes goes weeks at a time without seeing any use.","My favorite neighborhoods are Cleveland Park, Mt. Pleasant, and Woodley Park with Mt. Pleasant being my favorite. They're simply beautiful, centrally located, and very walkable. Mt. Pleasant has the added bonus of a lot of food and grocery choices. 

I like the other two cause they're on the red line"
"DC as a whole is pretty bike friendly, it’s the Maryland drivers you need to keep an eye on. NOMA has the MBT which is pretty great",I’m a top 1% capital bikeshare user and carless. That and metro make cars unnecessary for my life and I couldn’t be happier about it,Kalorama has got to be one of the most gorgeous neighborhoods in the world. Cathedral Heights and Cleveland Park are beautiful too.
"As a regular cyclist, overall, the city is fairly bikeable. There aren’t many pure bike lane-dedicated “neighborhoods” per se. You’re more likely to find that in order to get from A-B, your route may be influenced by the presence of bike lanes.

That being said, living near the MBT in Brookland has been very commutable. Columbia Heights has a bike lane up/down 14th. There are a smattering downtown.

If you go to Google Maps, you can turn on the bike lane view and really take a look at the options.","Agreed.

My late wife and I bought our last house specifically because it was walking distance to a Green Line metro station while still being a short drive to her workplace.

I used to only drive to Home Depot / Lowes and maybe the grocery store, and 99% of those trips were on the weekend.",The neighborhoods I like the most I can afford the least.
DuPont / Logan circle. Downtown. All good areas.,"I bought a car a year and a half ago for a job I left eight months later ... but I work full-time from home, I live two blocks from a Safeway and shopping including two CVSs, multiple restaurants, and worst of all: an amazing bookstore, and a wonderful library with weekly booksales. 

Unfortunately, since the car market has seemingly collapsed, I'm upside down on my car. I drive maybe once or twice a week. And I complain, but I have a good rate on insurance, have good gas mileage, and I love driving a 6-speed. (Plus it's easier to visit friends in Baltimore and family on the Eastern Shore).",Mt Pleasant. Great community with a diverse Main Street and accessible transit.
"Capitol Hill has some really nice bike lanes, plus it's just pretty cute. While H Street itself is terrible for bikes, a block north or south have decent protected lanes. Plus it's much less hilly than much of NW.","Bro every now and again I have to jump my car bcuz I hardly drive it and the battery, for lack of a better phrase, just conks out",I love Cleveland park. It’s quiet friendly and safe and I’ve gotten to know my neighbors really well. It’s not the coolest neighborhood but I love it here.
"Live as close to the National Mall, Rock Creek Park, or the MBT as you can(these all have good connections to dedicated lanes), and also within walking distance of metro and a grocery store.",[deleted],"> seems like there always gonna be someone hating some area I search for lol.

I feel like half of these complaints are people holding on to whatever they were doing before “there’s no Mexican food like southern California” “I can’t park my car on the sidewalk like Philadelphia” “there aren’t $3 beers like my Midwest college town where industry left 40 years ago and the only economic driver left was the university.” Go explore places and enjoy what you enjoy, don’t worry about other people."
"I think it really depends what neighbourhood you end up working in, or where you plan to be spending most time (away from home) in DC. 

E.g. if you're commuting to Capitol Hill, living close to the Metropolitan Branch trail is going to give you a far more pleasant cycling experience than living in NW (DuPont/AdMo etc). If you're working in NW or Bethesda or wherever, that's going to be a different set of considerations. IME the bike routes running north-south are a lot better (more protected, less stop and start) than the bike routes running east-west.",We had two cars. Downsized to one. It gets out maybe once a week. But super useful for trips outside of DC which are something like a monthly type thing.,I like DuPont Circle and Georgetown for their architecture and eateries.
I would recommend a neighborhood south of Florida Ave unless you've got an e-bike or have shredded calves. Biking up the hills to get to Columbia Heights or Petworth sucks sometimes.,For me it’s the capital bike share. If it’s above 40 I bike. I love it. I wish I felt safer but the bikes themselves and their ecosystem are great. All else is metro which mostly takes me to work. I haven’t explored far out yet (been here 5 months now).,"I'm seeing a lot of Mt. Pleasant, but how about Takoma and Brookland? People are so friendly in both places (in an already friendly city). Plus the housing there is pretty cool. I just know these neighborhoods from biking through a bunch of times and they both feel like happening places to be lol. Lots of activities and close to the Metro."
"Lots of DC is super bike-able. Just know that bike theft is rampant so plan accordingly, maybe get an absolute beater to start.","Thanks to Metro, Uber, and Free2Move, I have not owned a car since I moved from upper NW to Gallery Place 20 years ago. So unnecessary to drive if you plan ahead.","20007+ 20008 + 20009 are all very nice .

I recommend renting a condo in an old building. 
They have more character, are better built, large spaces, high ceilings , hardwood floors . Some have roof terrace. 

Newer construction is mostly cheaply built."
ooh thanks for the suggestion!,The bus is a bigger reason why I only use my car a few times a months.  I wouldn’t have a car if my parents didn’t live in a non-transit accessible part of central PA,"I've lived in Eckington, LeDroit Park, Columbia Heights, Eastern Market, and Palisades. I have close friends in Petworth, Brookland, Benning, H Street, Logan Circle, Navy Yard, Carver Langston and I'm probably forgetting or conflating some. Every single one has it's charm. Different strokes for different folks, absolutely. But I would take any of them if I had a place to call home. I even got to like College Park when I first moved here in the summer and had to get downtown everyday in a suit. This is an amazing area to live in, full of it's challenges but always worth it to me. And yeah, just because of all the other comments, Mt
 Pleasant is dope."
">Honestly the city as a whole has become very bike friendly.

*By US standards. There are still major gaps in the cycling network unfortunately.","I used to drive to work every day but I got the unlimited metro pass and no longer drive at all. Takes longer but I can read, text people, and do stuff instead of focusing on not crashing","DuPont, it feels like a small town with a lot of charm and friendly people."
The murderous drivers somehow still manage to make it unfriendly,"Ever since the silver line extension, I drive only a couple of times a month and love it!",Started with Georgetown and Dupont about 15 yrs ago because they were easier to get to from where I lived. Then U St followed by H st. Petworth has been my favorite for a good 5 yrs now because it's more relaxed.
FYI OP 15th Street has a very steep hill from W to Euclid...steep enough that a lotta people bike downhill using bikeshare and take a bus back uphill.,Same. I take the metro every day to work. Car is just for the weekend basically,I live in Cleveland/Woodley Park (the zoning is technically WP but I spend more time in CP) but I'd move to Mt. Pleasant
"I'd like to use a bike as a major form of transportation for everything -- going to work, running errands, general exercise, meeting up with friends, etc. I'll most likely be working remotely for the first few months of my job in DC so I won't need it for commuting initially but may eventually.","I do a combo of metro, walking, Uber, and driving depending on where I have to go. Right now, I drive maybe 2-3 days each month- it comes out to about 3k miles a year. Without metro, it would probably be 2-3 days each week.",I live in Petworth and absolutely love it. I only sort of knew it before I moved here--mainly had just been to a couple places on Upshur. But it's a really pleasant neighborhood with a great mix of people and it's very quiet and friendly even though it's an easy walk to several hotspots for bars and restaurants.
Until that time Conn Ave is super dangerous. Avoid. Plus much uphill.,"Sold my car and bought a very old ""fun car"" since reliability wouldn't be a concern. I probably drive once or twice every couple of weeks. Access to things, including other cities, without a car is one of the main reasons we live here.","Michigan Park.  It won’t get love from most.  But it is very quiet, the homes are getting upgraded, and community is diverse.  Only thing lacking are good restaurants and store fronts."
"I'm assuming MBT = Metropolitan Branch Trail? I didn't realize this was a thing! This will definitely factor into my neighborhood choice, as I was initially mostly considering NW DC neighborhoods.","I’m a DC native and although I grew up with my parents both owning cars and then moving away and living in densly populated cities, I stand by my point to live car-free for the rest of my life. I hate driving and I don’t see the point in having one when I can just metro/bike/scooter everywhere with an ocassional uber ride. No regrets! 

I bike to work everyday. I use Metro (mainly bus) to run errands/visit places and people. Scooter if I am in a rush/running errands (if I don’t feel like biking) and will Uber ocassionaly. Not super often. 

I don’t regret it. I would not be able to afford a car if I had one anyway.","In terms of sheer beauty, it's definitely Georgetown. It is the best preserved neighborhood in DC and is full of beautiful trees and landscaping. Mt Pleasant is also very cool and feels a bit like a village within the city. out of all the DC neighborhoods, Mt Pleasant feels the most ""hipster"" and grungy which is a nice change of speed for DC ."
"To be fair, lot of DC ""has"" the MBT. It officially goes up through Brookland (soon Ft. Totten?) and will eventually link Silver Spring to Union Station/NOMA.

MBT-adjacent neighborhoods currently include NOMA, Eckington, Edgewood, Brookland, and arguably/soon Michigan Park (per Google Maps; I'm not going to open up an argument about which of the aforementioned is ""actually a real neighborhood"")

Anyway, the MBT is quite nice for riding. My pet peeve is that there are too many people on electric ""bikes"" that are both fast and careless. However, the double-edged sword is that it's also very popular with walkers and joggers. They slow down the electric bikes but also the manual ones. I don't find it much of a nuisance since people are pretty good about staying to the right, but once in a while...","Living in a walkable neighborhood is the reason my car stays in a garage.

Metro is the reason I own one in the first place.",DuPont!
"The MBT is amazing. I find the 14th bike lane really unsafe as there are constantly drivers (esp food delivery & taxis) parked in it, pulling in and out of it etc.","I drive twice a week, once to my kid's swim lesson and once to Lidl or Costco.","I'll boost Glover Park. I didn't know the neighborhood before I went apartment hunting (and I grew up in Arlington). It doesn't have Metro or nightlife, but it's a wonderful little community with many different incomes living together, and close to nature and nightlife not too far away."
"The bike lanes on G and I streets are not protected, it's just paint on the ground.",I drive maybe once or twice a month. If it weren't for the metro i would probably drive a couple times a day. The metro is a big part of the reason i moved here.,"South of Lincoln Park. I love it here, lots of low-density housing breaks up the noise. Ton of green space. I'm young but I like the fact that there is a mix of families and single professionals. It makes it feel more homey than NoMa where I felt a little claustrophobic with all the high density buildings."
"15th St at Meridian Hill is well protected, but yeah you will be huffing and puffing trying to climb it on a regular bike.","I might be able to get by a bit, but I'd still need a car to get to work out in Tysons one day a week.

I'm planning to move to Baltimore soon though, and probably will still do MARC + Metro for that one day I have to go into the office a week.",Columbia heights.
"Yeah, that’s it!","I personally keep my car out of the city with family, but since i’ve lived here I have only ever needed it about 6 or 7 times. Just to move/pickup furniture or travel somewhere that requires a little bit more distance than the metro can take me. The public transportation here is honestly working out super well for me!",Takoma!!!
i live in NOMA right next to the trail and it’s great for biking down to union station or up further north!,I wouldn't live in this area.  The traffic would be appalling.,Noma
"My favorite trail in the city. Quite flat, minimal vehicle crossings, great breweries and bars along it. Close to the Red Line in case weather changes or my plans do and I want to get home quickly.",When I stay in dc i park my car in a garage and don’t use it til I’m leaving.,Fort Totten Metro & Kennedy Street is my hood and I fucking love it.
Join us in brookland!!!,"We’re in Brookland so we grocery shop in Hyattsville typically. I drive my car for about 30 minutes total every Sunday to do so. Not as impressive as you OP but I love that I’m only in it for 2ish hours a month now. 

Everything else is metro (special shout-out H8 bus) all the way!","I miss Adams Morgan so much. When I lived there I'd also walk up to Mt Pleasant and daydream about living there. We're in SW and really love it too (the proximity to the water is great), it's a great fit for us. I'm also infatuated with Brookland and would love for that to be our next move, if we can swing it"
"It is a good trail to get you from Eckington Yards, Edgewood, Brookland or even Brentwood to Downtown quickly.  It has gotten more of the electric conveyances, of late. Too many of the people who use those things on trails are even worse than Spandex Boys are on streets.

I even will use it to go to Nationals Park, although it stops near where the coal yards used to be near the ""New York Ave."" subway stop.  From there, I simply go to First Street, which has bicycle lanes to the Station.  From the Station, there are several ways to get to the ball park.

Generally, people do stay to the right regardless of what they are using.  If you ding your bell, they will give a little more to the right.

The Navy Yard/Ballpark/Southwest area is not bad for bicycles, either.  It is mostly flat or close to it.  If you are coming down New Jersey Ave. off Capitol Hill,though, do make sure that you have good brakes, as there is a steady stream of jaywalk-ER-uh-PEDESTRIANS that cross at the intersection with I St.,  S.E.

The bicycle paths in Rock Creek Park are pretty good.  I wish that more people would use them.

Woodley Park is pretty good.  If you are trying to get to it from DuPont, though, there is a really nasty hill on Connecticut Ave.  If you ride a few blocks west from DuPont to Rock Creek Park, the gradient on the Cathedral Avenue ramp is  milder but longer.

The streets in both Old and New Downtown have bicycle lanes, but do look out for trucks and the motorists who are making turns from the one way streets.  The turn lane crosses the bicycle lane at one point and no one, motorist or bicyclist, seems to be looking for the other.  Trucks do like to park in those lanes .  Uber/Lyft drivers also are there waiting for the typical passenger who typically is not aware of his surroundings (or just does not care), thus takes his sweet time coming out of the address.

D.C. do es make many accommodations for bicycle riders.  It *ain't quite* Minneapolis/St. Paul, but it might get there one day.","I'll take the flip side of this - metro is not a convenient option from my location in the 'burbs. I use it a single digit number of times per year, mostly when I have friends in town and I'm playing tourist in the city with them all day. I *hate* driving in this area more than words can describe, but I do it every day out of necessity. If metro were an option for my daily commute, I would use it.","I enjoy living in SW, being fairly central yet pretty quiet, aside from having few good food options, which isn’t usually a problem since I cook. However I also find Capitol Hill super pleasant"
Is there any word on when it will be finished through Fort Totten?,"“How much more would you be driving if you needed to drive somewhere but didn’t have an alternative mode of transportation?”

“I guess I would drive more frequently.”

“Thant makes sense.  More.  Gotcha.”","Navy Yard, has everything you’d want in terms of restaurants and bars, next to the Nats and DC United, and green line can get you to other neighborhoods very quickly. Not to mention the apartments are nice for the price than most other comparable units in the city"
Worse thing on the MBT is the occasional Vespa and/or motorcycle. I wish I was kidding,"Zero. I gave up on Metro about 5 years ago after riding it for +30 years. Haven't looked back, don't miss it one bit (at least not its current state– it was fantastic in the 80–90s).","Woodley Park, Cleveland Park, Clarendon in Arlington"
"I get really annoyed with guys on a long fast ride who use the MBT for part of it who get annoyed at pedestrians. Get out of town if you want a long ride, don’t try to set a PR on a pedestrian artery.","I drive 4-5 days a week *because* of Metro. 

Pre-pandemic I had a bus - metro commute and since the time schedules haven't been back to normal. I begrudgingly made the switch to the car commute, then realized it was a blessing in disguise. It reallyyyyy sucks if you miss the bus and next one is in 20 minutes then it's just a domino effect to catching a train. It takes me 20 min to drive or 45min public transportation hitting transfers door to door. 

My company gives us either $150/month for public transportation or free parking spot in the garage so it was a no brainer to be like ""jk can I switch plz""). It's not even a cost thing bc I used to get $90/month unlimited pass and pocket the rest of my transport benefit...

As service slowly rebounds, I am starting to do a hybrid but damn is it rough to convert back after having the conveniences. I comically got motion sickness when I took metro for first time in months.

In my non work commute, my day to day, I usually walk or ebike bc things I need are within walking/biking distance. 

I'm actually planning to move and broadening my geographical search to neighborhoods that aren't directly on top metro line but within a mile and served by bus.","If I move into DC from the suburbs, I’m moving to H St or Mt Pleasant."
"There are two awkward points for the MBT. The first is at the dewdrop inn, where it kinda ends for a bit until you get to Monroe. 

The second is the end of the MBT around the Noma station is a little chaotic- I thought they were going to build something to link it up better to Union Station?",I wouldn't live in a city without a metro or equivalent,Moved to Petworth a few years ago and cannot say enough about it.

"Are you trying to trigger me? If so, well done! (Kidding of course) Anything gas-powered on the MBT grinds my gears, especially on days like today (one of the first nice days of the year, so everyone is out and about).","I was driving 30 some odd miles every day. Now I drive/walk/bike a mile to the Metro. I cannot remember the last time I got gas. It's great!

Biggest complaint is walking is uphill both ways, so the band where the weather is good is very slim. Bike is quick but the drivers between home and the Metro are nuts.","Cleveland park, Kalorama, Adam’s Morgan, Woodley Park"
"Cops patrol on their big bikes. They’re going like, 2 MPH and I assume it’s to deter other gas powered vehicles (a bike might struggle to catch the 4 wheelers I’ve seen on there) but there’s not a ton of room for them. Same for DPR trucks and gators you see on there too.

The main drag of the MBT is part of my running route. So I’m on there 4-5 times a week. 
I’ve seen the rare ATV and dirt bike on there. RARE. Those rental mopeds though- the slightly bigger ones- are distressingly common. They should be geoblocked there if possible.",someday i will convince my family to move downtown and the first thing i will do is turn my car into scraps,"It's got its issues, and I'm sure is not for everyone, but I enjoy living here in Chinatown."
"Couldn't you make the counterargument that there are even more sidewalks than bike lanes, so pedestrians should stick to walking on the sidewalks? It's specifically [for pedestrians and bicycles](https://ddot-cp-met-branch-tr-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/), so not a ""pedestrian artery.""

I'm not advocating for 20mph pelotons to ride the MBT, but I think you're being a little heavy handed","daily


I only really drive for pleasure here","I have lived in Fairfax, VA for 300 yr and it's great, I'm just south of Herndon."
There is a “protected” bike lane to Union from Noma. Fuckwads still find a way to block it though.,Bro this is def WMATA burner account 😭😭,My favorite neighborhood is any neighborhood that is outside the legal boundaries of DC.
"There are two supposed southern termini for the MBT. 

 One is at the ""New York Avenue"" subway where you have the switchback ramp.  You can ride in one of the bicycle lanes to First St, then south to the station.  As the commenter remarks, often there is a truck blocking it or an Uber/Lyft driver awaiting a customer who is taking his sweet time emerging.  You also will see the occasional FUBAR Cheats or Floor Trash driver who blocks it.

The other terminus is at L St.  You ride past the switchback ramp through a gap in the fence, that is paved and come to a stair.  I have carried my bicycle up or down that stair more than once.  Mind you, I am carrying a 2009 re-issue of a 1953 Schwinn heavyweight three speed, not a carbon-aluminum ultra lightweight mountain bicycle.

You can do it, but, like you, I do wish that there were a neater connexion to either First St. or the station.

If I recall correctly (and now you are going to make me look the next time that I go by there) there are ""sharrows"" on Eighth St past the Dewdrop Inn then you get bicycle lanes on Monroe St.  There actually is supposed to be a path constructed that will take you up either Puerto Rico Ave, or Mc Cormack Drive, I forget which side of the tracks, now.  So far, it has been only talk-talk and vapourware.  At some point, it is supposed to go to Silver Spring and link with the Capital Crescent Trail to create a ""bicycle beltway"", if you will.  In reality, the path of the latter is also a bit ""chaotic"" once you leave the point where the old Georgetown Branch switched off the Metropolitan Sub, near Forest Glen Station, to head into Silver Spring.",I’d go from driving 2 days a week for work to 5. I only drive those 2 days because I have to go from DC out to Maryland and it’s not convenient at all to metro/bus to that area.

I wonder if one could somehow incentivize people to return to empty stations.

You could possibly look at the rate of how quickly stations fill or empty at different times of day.

Hauling around my gear on a bike trailer/cart, 90% of the time my best option is to use Capital Bikeshare, and I might use the metro or bus to get to the general vicinity. Sometimes I'll ride my ebike instead, especially if there are no CaBi stations near my destination. Every once in a while I have to rent a car to play a gig way out in Stevensville or something.

"Yeah for me in the morning I liked cruising half a mile on one to the Metro when there'd be a bike available. I usually go in around 10 AM so it's worth it since it can mean the difference between just catching one train or just missing it and waiting 12 minutes for the next one.

I didn’t really have a choice because I needed the money, but it would have been a good decision regardless. I save so much money not owning a vehicle and having my employer pay for my Metro commute","The fact that many stations have only a single entrance or two is one of my frustrations with metro in DC.  Because of its inability to decide if it wants to be metro or commuter, it has long platforms.  If you only give a single entrance, many people may need to walk across practically the whole station (but above ground) to get to the entrance, wasting several minutes of time.  Crossing streets is another one.  (let's not even talk about the silver line stations where you have to walk across a bridge over the interstate that's practically longer than the distance between stations).

A lot of the systems I find best tend to have at least four entrances per new metro station: two on either side of the road close to the front and back ends of the platforms, with the line aligned to a major street.  This substantially reduces the perceived distance to a station from any point in the city.

The city's bike infra is built out to the point now that there's not very many places you can't get to by bike path if you don't want to.

"Capitol Hill seems to have the least amount of car traffic and most bike lanes. Agree that is hard to go wrong as long as you’re near a metro station somewhere in DC.

Also, if you are planning on using capital bike share (which is a pretty good deal), you should be aware that bike/dock availability is dicey in many NW DC areas. DC gets very hilly in NW, so it seems to me that many will bike downhill but don’t make the return trip. Navy Yard, Capitol Hill, and SW DC seem to always have pretty good availability for bikeshare.

"Hey, there's a lot of good advice here. One thing I'd recommend is looking up bike maps like this one which I saved on my phone as a reference whenever I bike someplace newer: https://ddot.dc.gov/page/bicycle-maps

Echoing what others have said, the city core, SW waterfront, and east of the Capitol from Florida Ave on south tend to be pretty bikeable (and those latter areas I mentioned are low on commuter car traffic usually). Up north things get sparser but there are bike corridors along 14th St you can take safely all the way to Takoma metro, and of course the MBT.

Areas to avoid or be cautious about when it comes to bikeability: Southeast is really lacking compared to west of the Anacostia. Northwest west of Rock Creek Park is hilly. The big avenues (Connecticut, Mass, Wisc) I'd plan on not biking unless it's downhill, but I've done all those during weekend levels of traffic.

The capital crescent trail, once you get on it in Georgetown, doesn't connect to anything else until you're well into MD so don't plan on that as a bikeable shortcut.

Also to be wary: crossing New York Ave once east of Florida Ave. Technically you can at the circle with WV Ave but it's a mess of traffic and so many cyclists have been struck there. SD Ave, RI Ave and Bladenburg Rd are not bikeable, so you have to rely on side streets and it can be really hilly.",How many stations have you collected?,New York Ave (NoMa) is already an extra station. Some of us remember when that wasn’t there.

This will give you an idea of which neighborhoods will also see the biggest expansion of PBLs over the next couple of years. My understanding is all of the lanes on this map have dedicated funding sources so they *will* happen.

Currently live in NoMa and the northern connection via MBT is great and will fully connect to Silver Spring and the northern trails in the next couple of years, as well as protected connections down to the Mall and many other trails around the district.",Why capital bike share vs getting your own bike at that point?,So what on earth are they building behind the Target up there at the end of Glebe if this js just now getting funded?
Hijacking this thread because I'm moving to Arlington in the summer and have a similar question. How is the bike infrastructure across the river? Does anyone know which Arlington neighborhoods would be the most bike friendly?,Adams Morgan?,"They are virtually connected; if you exit one station and enter the other within, I think, 15 minutes, the farecard system treats you like you never left. A tunnel would be cool, but I think there’s just too much infrastructure to work around to make it feasible."
Depends on what kind of housing you're looking for. Apts than NOMA/Union Market District/Navy Yard. If row house/English basement than Capitol Hill. I've lived in NE/SE for over a decade and bike everywhere. Much safer than in NW (b/c more car traffic) and generally more relaxed vibe.,"Yeah, me too. I need to go for a drive this weekend, lol",That Farragut connector is something I've always thought would make a lot of sense
Keep putting in complaints on the bikeshare app when you encounter empty stations in NW. They need enough complaints that they can't ignore it and start redistributing bikes up the hill.,i had this problem during the summer 😂,"I've always thought it was odd that Cleveland Park and Van Ness got an entrance on both sides of Conn. Ave, but Woodley Park only got a single western entrance, despite having higher ridership than both stations and being in a livelier area.

The knock-out panels are quite visible at Archives and Pentagon City."
But in CapHill are they *protected* bike lanes ??,Same,Federal Triangle has a knock-out panel in case they tore down the old Post Office building.
Arlington is actually an amazing city for biking,"Wait, do you mean Bmore to Tysons commute?",I wonder if that new entrance to the Navy Yard station will be incorporated into whatever they build on that vacant lot south of M. That seems like one of the last parcels of land where construction isn't either imminent or in progress right now.

"That's good to hear, are there good paved bike trails/lanes in Ballston or Calrendon?","Metro astroturfing this sub is funny. Don’t forget that they ran those defective trains knowingly for four years, could have fixed them during the pandemics peak, chose not to, a train derailed, and high level execs were allowed to resign without anyone facing consequences.","NaLa is just stupid, imprecise name. For one, it's quite a distance from one point to the other, so just using the nearest metro stop's name makes way more sense. Second, why is everything here named 'National'? Like the National Landing is across the Potomac from the National Harbor, neither of which are all that great anymore for mooring larger ships."
The Custis Trail will take you to the WOD and that will take you many more places.,BACK2GOOD,"It’s unbelievably frustrating that there’s only one tiny, cramped staircase for anyone north of Florida Ave in Eckington to reach the metro entrance. They deconstructed the ramp for some construction project on Florida, too."
Just looked it up and it seems pretty awesome. Excited to try it out this summer,😂,The North one has a lot more faregates.
Just get ready for those hills on the Custis!,"I have the option of reserved parking space at my office, but I opted for riding the Metro instead. It takes about the same amount of time, but I can sit back and read a book whilst the train whisks me to the office instead of dealing with traffic.","A second Crystal City entrance is already in the design phase.

I never understood why this isn’t a tunnel from metro center to Gallery Place/Chinatown. I would save people time going from B/O/S to Y/G"
"I mean, *if* the store’s customers primarily drove cars to the store and *if* the protected bike lane removed parking availability and *if* it was easy for driving customers to switch to an alternative store so revenue for the affected store dropped and *if* the store sold inelastic goods and *if* the store was locally owned and had control of pricing, then…there would be a mechanism for the bike lane to cause higher prices. Highly implausible and this guy seems a little out there, but I wouldn’t dismiss the guy as stupid. I’d just ask for proof of all the conditionals above!
Pls don’t downvote me to hell","i sometimes wish we'd just pull the trigger and liquidate the car we only use occasionally. it is like a child and their safety blanket. 

the car is such a hassle to deal with!",Well they have the 'virtual tunnel' now that allows you to exit on station and enter the other for free so I doubt that they'll ever spend the money to make an actual tunnel unfortunately.
Just make the coleslaw yourself! It will be so much cheaper!!!,[deleted],"Farragut was supposed to be one station originally, NPS objected to trees being cut down in Farragut Square. So then we get two stations, and the trees were cut down anyway later."
Oh wow. I thought this was a joke e-mail not some real life nut job asking real questions,"In the app go to the sidebar then ""view profile."" In the account settings section it should say the number of stations visited and which % of riders you're in. I'm not sure how they calculate it but it seems like it's by total stations visited rather than total distance or amount of rides, so it could be more accurate","During the time the station was being planed, the east side of Connecticut Avenue did not have sufficient traffic to justify a second east side of Connecticut Avenue surface entrance.

My commuter is good for when I have a safe place to store it (my office). But if I'm going out on the weekend or evenings, I will almost always use a bikeshare. No worries about theft, plus if it gets late and I need to call a taxi home, I don't have to come back for the bike. Drivers also give bikeshare users more room!

The thing about bikes is that they are so cheap compared to cars. You usually can easily afford a bike and bike rental!","Yes, along with a segment of a partly built [passageway](https://goo.gl/maps/LV3Kg7mBsBHsyU9FA) from the north mezzanine in Union Station to a future entrance at H Street.

Thought this was that Nick... Unsurprised. The video of him yelling in front of pre schoolers is a real gem.,I'm absolutely paranoid about my bike/wheels getting stolen. The convenience of being able to dock and forget about bikes is worth the extra few minutes of walking to/from stations and the annual fee. I also bike recreationally and use my (fairly nice) bike for that,"the ramp as in the wooden one? that was only put there recently and it was always meant to be temporary, I'm assuming whatever they're building in its place will have a more permanent solution"
Yeah that’s the Safeway on 17th,i love cap bikeshare because i dont have to spend time findign spot for bike and i just dock it and go . i dont have to worry about bike being stolen,"There's also an elevator that's perpetually out of order as well.

No it's the one in Dupont. 17th NW. (Ward 2?),"Yup, 2 hours. For the cheaper COL and some other things going on in my life, it's manageable. It could be more like 1h 15min if I left real early and drove.....but I rather ride transit and least do something and have it take an extra hour.",🧋🥪
Hyper local inflation? Caused by a bike lane? Visible on precisely one consumer good's price but no others? It's more likely than you think!,Paying more taxes for metro > cheaper gas,And yet I was charged recently despite spending no less than 5 minutes outside
Nope.  This guy is on record as saying “Connecticut avenue was destroyed by bike lanes and all the businesses closed” and has his own “civic association” that yells at ANC commissioners about the PBL on 17th,me too,"They do that in Moscow, and it's both very confusing and extremely helpful."
This IS his hobby.,People who live within walking distance of a grocery store usually go multiple times a week and only carry a few bags back.,At least it's something I suppose
I was wondering if this was him when I say saw this on IG,Buy groceries several times a week and have two carts - one for regular grocery trips and one for big grocery trips or bulky items.,There sort of is if you count the elevator.

Your coleslaw is not the topic of conversation here,"Ahhh I didn’t see that, just the bookstore and I thought it was lost city books.","I mean that’s just an accessibility requirement. But also, I would advocate for a new elevator over a new entrance. The current elevator goes so slow compared to the one in Rosslyn, which seems double the speed. You can only ride it down 1-2 times every ten minutes which requires you to have to come pretty early to not miss your train."
you wouldn't say it in Utica,weekend trips? lol. cars make us like toddlers. we hold onto things for non rational reasons.,There looks to be enough space to turn that area into a ramp. More capacity and it makes things easier to transport all the things that roll.

Capitol Hill. Fairly close to the 'city center' and good bike lanes and easy access to the Anacostia trail network.,"It can be a process.

Mount pleasant or Eckington or admo.,Amtrak?,"TL; DR: my personal experience definitely agrees
 
I've lived in urban areas for the last 15 years between two different cities, after moving out of the suburbs.  City-living has definitely been more cost-effective, especially because I've never wanted a large property or a yard I have to spend an entire afternoon or pay someone to care for it.  Car-related expenses alone save close to $4K a year (and I'm not even including gas in that equation). I have all the routine needs within 3-block radius, from groceries, bus stop and metro station, bank, dry cleaners, gym, barber, my local bar, etc etc. Beyond the money-savings it's also a huge time saver, which, for me, is more valuable. I can't remember the last time I ""circled around the block to find parking."" Going out with friends means Metro, free-bus or uber, and I'm there in 15 minutes.  When I used to commute to Tysons via Metro, I worked out a deal with my employer that I would ""start working"" on the train. So I was all caught up with work emails and docs to read by the time I got to the office. On a typical day, I worked 6.5 hours at the office and left at 3:30PM-ish every day. On my way home, I read for pleasure. Get home at 4:45PM. At the gym by 5:00PM. Shower at home, cook, eat, clean up. And I'd still have three-plus hours of free time."
"I’m aware of all the hills and lack of bike lanes on Connecticut Ave, but I’m going with Woodley Park/Cleveland Park. Tried my best to stay in the area and I’ve had luck. Connecticut Ave can be chaotic especially near the Zoo, but having klingle trail less than half a mile away is super nice.","I feel like they always say Tuesday afternoon is *the worst* time to depart for Thanksgiving, or at least that was the case last year. Something about more people taking Wednesday off. I’d recommend Amtrak.","I have noticed the same and will add that as I get older, I notice the time savings much more so than the financial savings. You can spend more time on the things that are important to you if you don't have to factor in significant travel time or expense to do them. Walking the kids two blocks to school is a dream. Also, tending to a larger house and a yard is a huge investment of time."
Depends on where you need to get to. I like Capitol Hill up to Brookland myself/ie the east side of town because it feels less crowded with cars and there are a lot of bike lanes. But I also work on this side of town and am happy to hang here. Biking to NW has gotten better since they added a protected East - west lane by CU.,Might be worth it to drive out to eastern shore and up 301,"Been in the dc area about 20 years. No car that whole time.

"Most of the city is ok for biking, but bike lanes are popping up all the time in the city. I would think any walkable neighborhood would also end up being good for biking.

Even around holiday times from my experience there isn’t much traffic before 6 or so, but once you start getting later than that it increases at an almost comedic rate. 

If you wait til “late morning” it will be an absolute shitshow","As someone who's been in DC for about a decade now, I absolutely agree. 

I have friends who have houses (some out in Fairfax and others back in FL where I'm from) and I will 100% say that while I love their space, I love the fact that I'm able to walk out of my building and be in the city. Need to go to a store? I can go directly downstairs. Need to go to a theater or bar? I'm a quick 15/min walk or metro ride away from some cool places. 

At the end of the day, I'll take a smaller place in a city over a house at the end of the day."
"Silver Spring. I started on my bike late morning, meandered thru Rock Creek Park trails, and am now on C&O towpath. I'll take Metro back home. My two non-negotiables when i was moving this spring were (1) balcony and (2) near bike trails. Downtown Silver Spring ticked both boxes.","We used to go to Philly all the time to see friends for the weekend.  If I couldn't be on the road by noon I'd just take the train up.  Traffic gets painful on I-95.  Plus, unless you are staying in Philly for the holiday, you may get caught in crazy traffic leaving Philly and coming home too!

ETA: that would be getting on the road by noon on Friday, in case I wasn't clear.","I’m just going to drop a stream of consciousness ramble here: I stayed in DC throughout the pandemic and remember how apocalyptic it seemed in the first weeks. I remember working from home in my window alcove and watching a neighbor load up their station wagon to the point it was almost touching the ground as they headed for the hills never to return, and taking walks around deserted and ominous streets. And then of course came the protests/unrest that summer, watching guardsmen in riot gear roll by that same window and the bizarre nights like picking up my wife from her front-line healthcare job and getting home just as the curfew took effect, Lincoln Park deserted before 7pm, and then later walking down to the Capitol on 1/6 to see with my own eyes (you know my ass wasn’t missing history of that magnitude) the terrible events of the day.

I guess if there’s a point to all that, it’s that it felt like sort of a reward for keeping the faith and believing in DC’s future that we were able to become homeowners during this period. Everybody was acting like the city was dead and so prices were nuts for single family homes but that sort of gave me the opportunity to slide in and - unbelievably - find not just a condo but an actual king-of-my-castle rowhouse we could just *barely* afford. It ain’t much, but for a couple of kids who grew up in trailer parks in the rural South it is pretty damn amazing. 

And it’s not big, but after years of living together in literally one ROOM with a Murphy bed (if I wanted to stay up late I’d go and sit in the bathroom floor because it was the only separate room in the place 😆) even 1000 sq ft is amazing and I’ve found it helps encourage me to prune our stuff more often. I’ve never lived in a proper house in the suburbs, but the idea now feels me with dread, to be isolated in a big house behind a big lawn where I’m filling all the extra space with junk I don’t really need just to fill it. I don’t have much of a backyard to speak of, but I always say I don’t need one because the National Mall is like America’s front lawn and it’s *my* backyard."
"What do you mean by ""how good biking is in that neighborhood?"" Most bike rides would extend well beyond a single neighborhood, so we need to know more about what kind of biking you want to do.

"Potomac Yard, Alexandria VA 
Dupont Area, DC",Tuesday too? oof,"The cost of living shouldn't be just the cost of the mortgage/rent. It should be calculated as that cost + transportation + upkeep.

I feel like people here go out there and buy pretty large and cheap (relatively speaking) houses in the suburbs without realizing they also have to keep the house in good shape and usually need multiple cars to drive long distances.

I live in a 2 bed condo with my partner and we only have one small hatchback (we don't really need it tbh but we have a parking spot, we already had the car before moving here, and it's nice to use it on the weekends). Upkeep is also cheaper because the place is smaller and can walk/bike/use transit to almost anywhere we have to.

If we compare our situation to some of our friends, they have a larger house with a cheaper mortgage but they spend more on upkeep, utilities, need two cars and drive longer distances. Pretty sure we come up almost even on our monthly expenses.

It also comes down to how much space you need but, realistically I think most people's houses are waaaaay bigger than they actually need."

I pay just a little bit more in rent than I was (because I have since acquired a dog) but the number of free events across the city, the location (close to other major metro areas that you can access by a bus or train) and the fact that the city is filled with other type A, intellectually curious people — it’s a big change from where I grew up."
"I moved to Southwest so that I could live directly *on* the Anacostia River Trail. I need to cross something like two roads to get to Georgetown or Rosslyn (& points beyond), one for Alexandria, and one to get up to the east side of the Anacostia.

"It's not DC, but the absolute best place to live I found for biking was near Old Town Alexandria. Easy access to Mt. Vernon Trail, going either way, Four Mile Run, Gravelly Point, biking to Arlington Cemetery or into DC to see the monuments, and lots of food options to bike to.",I'd rather just postpone at that point haha,"Second this. Something else to note about having less space-you quickly find it’s just liveable if not more so than having plenty of it. My last place before DC was significantly larger: walk-in closet, own bathroom, large common space, etc. It was so big that I just kinda sprawled everything out. Why organize anything when there’s plenty of space? 

When I moved to DC though, the downsizing forced me to be organized quickly-if I didn’t I’d have no room! I quickly sorted my stuff and I found that having less space pushed me to be more efficient and intentional with not just how I organized my things but how I lived in general.

We as humans adapt to fill the space we’re in, no matter its size-we expand and contract as needed. Less space can be a blessing in disguise, especially considering the benefits you get from city living"
"I disagree strongly. I would pick a fairly flat neighborhood, probably not at higher elevation, surrounded by good bike infrastructure. To accomplish exactly what you state: leaving the neighborhood.",Leave early?,"Also…Think about all the health benefits from walking too.

It can be difficult to live in a 3+ bedroom dwelling near a Metro station or along a high-frequency bus line within a good school boundary.

We have built a lot of housing over the past decade, but most has been 1 or 2 bedroom, which means the price of 3+ bedroom dwellings has continued to increase at high rates. It is difficult to fit a family of 5+ with highschool-age kids in a 2 bedroom dwelling."

I lived without a car in a small college town pre-Amazon.  Everything I needed really was walking distance.  I imagine most Americans understand that experience even if they “hate” cities.

This only popped up a few days ago, however.",This is not necessarily my concern since I own a home in the suburbs but I honestly can appreciate what you are saying. There is a lot to be said for participating in cultural activities as well as easily going out to restaurants.
I'm in roslyn and really like being close to georgetown.,"Because the council has effectively made it unnecessary to pay camera infractions, the strategy is to to generate revenue by shotgunning out enough tickets that if even a tiny percentage of citizens are honest enough to pay their tickets, the city still makes tons of money.","Owning a car in DC does not have to be expensive. If it’s an old/cheap car, insurance will be cheap, especially because you’ll be driving fewer miles.  A parking permit and registration combined are under $200 for two years. I probably spent $1000-$1500 annually for a street parked vehicle, which is well worth it for easy access to the soup dumplings at Bob’s Shanghai and other forays in and outside of the city."
Funny two out of the three times I’ve been hit by a car in the bike lane were in Rosslyn and I’m a resident of DC!,"No, of course it won’t because DC doesn’t have reciprocity with any other state.

Their analysis says nothing about out of state drivers who frequent the District.

"So Eckington is really envious trail access and near location to multiple areas.

Want to get to the national mall?  Quick hop down MBT dumps you at the Capitol building.

Connect to C&O?  Ride through the mall 

Want to get to rock creek?  MBT up to Park and cut across to the rock creek entrance on tilden.

Headed to work downtown?  R st bike lane to 15th and done.

Most of these routes are downhills or flat leaving Eckington.  The MBT is a clutch connector trail.

For admo, it's tony NW but right before the big elevation gain to the Cleveland Park or van Ness or more northern areas.  You cross the bridge to hit the west side trails of rock creek.  Or you ride a couple blocks over to get to 15th.  As long as you work downtown, that is all straight down hill on way there.

Both of those allow you to bike commute at a leisure pace even in the summer (earlier in the day around 7-8:30) and not HAVE to shower at work. 

Eckington way more affordable and quiet than AdMo.  But if you want all the restaurants and nightlife, can't go wrong with AdMo.

Mount pleasant is a good mix, but less affordable these days.","To be honest you do need cams in some places. But a lot of cams in DC are just there to make money, for example the camera on k street I feel that one just wants to catch people. And the cams on both DC-295 and I-295.

OMG sorry. I thought that I was in the regular DC subreddit. lol,It will make the contractors who supply them rich.,"Yeah, I agree that it’s actually not all that more expensive to live here. My rent from $960 in Texas to $1800 here. But I also don’t live in Texas anymore. There were barely any public services or free things to do. I’ll pay the state income tax and rent increase to not live there.

And I got a new car, so I am paying some for a car. But registration and insurance is actually cheaper here than where I live in Texas. Insurance was really high there. I’m someone who likes the freedom of a car and can afford one, so I’ve made that choice. Street parking is cheap here too. It hasn’t been a burden. And I take public transit depending on what I’m doing. 

I live closer to work, so I’m not spending time on commuting. I have made that a priority since starting work after law school wherever I’ve lived. The time I get back in my day has also been very valuable to me. I’m way less stressed too. Living here is definitely worth it, and the value is there for me."
i was disoriented for a minute,All I know is traffic on 16th street actually goes the speed limit because of the expensive speeding camera tickets and it would be nice if traffic always went that slowly around pedestrians,Essentially my experience when I first moved from suburban Baltimore and a two-bedroom apartment to a studio in DC.

I would get an ebike if you can secure it at both ends of your commute. Take the lane when cycling.,No.,"Another thing is that the rent is higher, but it's for a better apartment.  Apartments in the suburbs suck, they invariably have thin wooden walls and also have a lot of loud children.  If you manage to find an apartment with solid walls in the suburbs (and good luck with that) you'll find it's much more expensive than the ""typical"" prices and/or has a waitlist months long."
"Check with your homeowner's or renter's insurance, it may cover a bike against theft even if the bike is stolen while out and about. Most ebikes are probably going to exceed the value that will be covered without a specific policy, though, so I would definitely look into a separate policy, because the likelihood of theft if you don't have a secure place to store it at home and work is pretty high.

As for crashes, well, you can do your best to be safe, but you can't 100% eliminate risk, especially when drivers are definitely not doing their best. If you're not comfortable riding in the city, or even if you just think you could stand to learn more, WABA runs a City Cycling class in the spring and fall. I haven't taken it, but have heard good things.

"As long as you have a secure place to store it overnight, you should be fine IMO. This means a garage, backyard shed, or physically in your house.  Locking it to a pole outside your house would likely end up stolen. I park mine in my buildings garage.

For trips out into the city, you should be fine with a good chain and u lock. The longer you're going to be away from it, the more protection you want though.

For instance, if I'm going to Columbia Heights or Chinatown for a long time, I lock up with:

1. My main, beefy chain lock through the rear wheel and frame

2. U lock through the center frame

3. Cable lock through front tire, secured to u lock.

4. Frame lock/Cafe lock (immobilizes rear wheel)

5. Chain attached to frame/cafe lock.

I also have an alarm that goes off is someone tries to move the bike.

Usually though, if I'm just shopping for a short amount of time, or am nearby, I just lock up with my chain lock. The lock I use is this, which is what the LockPickingLawyer uses on his personal bike.

I also have Velosurance, which adds a lot of peace of mind for me. I've had my bike for about a year now and have had no theft attempts.

When it comes to commuting in the city (especially the l'enfant city) an ebike is great. Most roads are 20 mph, which is how fast an ebike can go. So you can safely take the lane. Some drivers will still get angry, but you need to do what is safest for you. Avoid major high speed arterials, and get if the sidewalk if you can't avoid them.

On Google maps, there is an overlay that shows bike lanes in DC. It's not perfect, but it helps a lot. I would definitely recommend taking a more circuitous route that has good bike lanes over a shorter one with bad lanes. Over time you will memorize which streets you feel best on.

I think that's all the advice I have. Welcome to the party!","Unless they boot and impound the cars with outstanding tickets, this won't do a damn thing.  The idiots on the council just decided to let people with all of these fines renew their licenses.","Cars are expensive to have and maintain not just in terms of money but time, the most important resource for anyone at almost any life stage. Many folks wind up with small parts to replace here and there in addition to the mere need to service it. Tail lights can go out, knobs can break, someone can ding the body, etc.

Walking is good for you at basically any adult age. Not being able to go to the store in 5 minutes forces you to batch your trips together better to be more efficient. And so forth. We should be careful to not confuse conveniences for comforts."
"I wouldn't leave it outside overnight, regardless of the lock you use - I won't even leave my 100-dollar bike out all night because angle grinders.

"Yeah, lock it up with a good u-lock, and carry the battery with you if it is easily removed. But if you leave it locked up in a public place for long enough, it's a lot higher risk. Basically live your life, take appropriate precautions, and be prepared for anything you lock up to get stolen, because all locks are just temporary deterrents against a determined bike thief.

The problem isn't that they don't work, the problem is that they aren't used to actually systematically change driver behavior, they are just used to slow drivers down or generate revenue in a small number of targeted spots. Tripling cameras won't get there either, but it's a start - speeding cameras need to be *everywhere,* they shouldn't be tripled, there should be like 100 times as many. You shouldn't be able to drive anywhere without passing multiple speed cameras. *Then* people will actually slow down, especially if it is paired with real attempts to collect (e.g., vastly expanded booting operations and/or undoing the Council's recent decision to let people with multiple outstanding speeding tickets keep renewing their licenses and registrations).

I think this would help, yes.

"> a collection of sensible ways to get around

So, probably not what you're looking for then, but I've been trying to keep openstreetmap.org up-to-date when new bike-lanes are added!

The nice thing about openstreetmap is anybody can use the data you put there.  If you make an improvement, literally thousands of websites will pull that improvement in (and millions of users will indirectly get your new data).  For instance, I've been putting that data over here on my website:  https://cyclemap.us/#14/38.892/-77.035  My color choices there are:  green = paved, brown = unpaved.

If you want ""sensible ways to get around"", openstreetmap has another concept called a ""[local cycle network](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:network%3Dlcn)"" which is more than just a place you can ride, but a networked link of places you can ride decided by whoever puts up the literal biking signs on our streets.  Less formally, ""[relations](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:route)"" let you mark a bunch of things together as a cycling route, but still require the routes to be ""real"" and verifiable as defined by a publisher.",But they can put a camera on every street corner and justify it in the name of public safety like they do in China,Maybe just live a little closer to Tysons.

"Nice start! Your map skews heavily to the NW in current detail. I bike most of my time in NE and the Anacostia Tributary Trail System through Prince George's, and could help here. Here are some things that jumped out at me from my experience:  


1. All of the Anacostia trail routes should be on the map in the same manner as the Capital Crescent trail.  

2. The Trolley Trail between Hyattsville and College Park is a crucial utilitarian trail connection along Route 1 that needs to be here in the same manner as the Capital Crescent Trail  

3. For non-trail routes, I think you also need a good flat route over the ""Brookland Bump"" between the MBT and Mount Rainier/Route 1 corridor. Here's the \[admittedly complicated\] route I use, heading northbound: Starting at 8th and Monroe NE, turn left on 12th Street NE, turn right on Randolph Street NE, turn left on 13th Street NE, turn right on Ritchie Place NE, turn left on 14th Street NE, turn right on Taylor Street NE, turn left on 10th Street NE, then turn right on Varnum Street NE. It is zig-zaggy, but those turns flatten the Brookland hills considerably. Conceptually, it just sticks to the streetgrid on the southeastern side of Michigan Avenue.   

4. Alternatives to Benning Road NE are crucial for low-stress rides to the Anacostia Trails and Kingman Park. Headed eastbound is easier:  I follow Gales Street NE to 21st Street NE to E Street NE to Oklahoma Avenue. Westbound is more complicated, due to one-way streets and irregular street grid – I string together a still-shifting mix of alleys and streets to head westbound while avoiding Benning.   

5. Despite the incline, Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE and its bus lanes are probably the best way to bike into St. Elizabeths and the more southern parts of Southeast.",American as apple pie.,"I think it really starts paying off for the kids once they get to middle school age and can just walk home from after school activities and go where they want to go.

I moved here from Chicago, and your map reminded me of the Mellow Chicago Bike Map: https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/the-mellow-chicago-bike-map-our-guide-to-the-lowest-stress-routes-in-the-city/

It’s hard to define what constitutes a street people feel comfortable riding on; it’s very context-dependent, and it’ll vary a lot by the individual. But it’s always great to see people putting in the work to map out their own preferred routes to help share the local knowledge with others!","I'm all for traffic safety. I didn't have a car for almost 15 years living in DC. I bike a ton around the city and walk a lot as well. I can't even tell you the number of times I've seen people blow through red lights...

But that all being said, I think the traffic camera system is problematicnfor several reasons

1.) The revenue goes to the general fund rather than improvemenrs to traffic infrastucuture. Sure, some of it (maybe 10%) is spent on traffic safety improvements, but if it were really about traffic safety they'd be spending a lot more. 

2.) MD and VA drivers face no consequences for getting tickets, and they're the vast majority of reckless drivers.

3.) They're indiscriminate. I've received $100 for going 41 in a 35 at 2AM in an area with wide roads and no one on the streets at all seems excessively punitive to me.",Also general maintenance issues if you don’t use the car very much

I couldn’t hit that every time if I tried so I think some fuckery is going on. But some are my fault as a momentary loss in focus and also because the speed limits go from 35-30-25-20 across the city and some cams are at the bottom of steep hills or the one on kenilworth that is right next to the highway on/off ramps. Around schools and pedestrian walkways these are fine, but most are set up to make money not safety.

"> I have bikemap, which uses opencyclemap

Ok, then you already have it?  opencyclemap is openstreetmap, so everything I put into openstreetmap will already show up there.

It doesn't seem to be updated though!  Bikemap has some terribly old data.  I don't see the bikelanes on 20th st NW, or G st NW, or Virginia Ave (etc etc).  And opencyclemap's own website isn't showing shared-bus-cycleways on H and I streets.

As for how to embed data from one map to another, that's usually dependent on which map you're using.  I like to use geojson files and kml files and gpx files to get small amounts of data between maps because those formats are fairly open and can be used on almost any map.  But, getting the data into those formats isn't always easy.","There are no repercussions for not paying traffic camera tickets.

"Sure. Westbound I'd go from East Capitol, cross First St, then go straight toward the Capitol building along the plaza, then bear right (north) to reach the small road labeled Northwest Dr on Google maps. That empties out at a small traffic circle with the Peace Monument in it. Eastbound I use the path just south of Northwest Dr because the road is one way. It's a very wide path and on a steep upward hill, so you're going slow and there's no problem sharing with pedestrians.","Yeah - in DC's case, it's definitely revenue generating which is a shame because there's good data showing that, if implemented correctly, passive enforcement can reduce accidents and unsafe driving. However, this requires judicious placement of cameras and an actual enforcement mechanism for repeat offenders.

DC places their cameras where they're likely to catch people speeding, not necessarily in spots where enforcement is really needed.  For example, near my house there's a camera at the bottom of a hill on a four lane thoroughfare that is technically residential because there are some houses on it. The design of the street encourages people to drive above the posted speed limit and the placement of the camera at the bottom of a steep slope makes it all the more likely that people will be going above speed when they pass the camera.   There's another camera on an access road on 295 that for some inexplicable reason is 25mph but the speed markings are extremely unclear. Again, the design of the road encourages speeding and it's not really in an area where enforcement is badly needed.  Both of these cameras feel like traps. I'm sure they generate tons of revenue for the city, but they're not near pedestrian heavy areas of schools or the like.

Couple this with the lack of enforcement - no reciprocity with MD or VA, no requirement to pay violations to renew your license, not collections for over due tickets, barely any booting or towing - and there's virtually no incentive to pay attention to cameras. Sure - maaaaybe you'll get towed but it's pretty unlikely. People regularly wrack up $10K+ worth of tickets and face no consequences. Like I said, it feels like the city is playing a numbers game. Blast out tons of tickets and if even a small percentage pay up, it's big money. But the people that pay aren't the regular, repeat offenders.",Lol no thanks. Virginia is a place is all I'll say.

If the city really cared, they would make changes to roadways like narrowing them, creating bump outs, more speed humps, creating ped-only streets, etc. Speed cameras are purely a band aid, and the preferred band aid at that because the city can line its pockets whilst signing off on multi million dollar contracts with the camera installation and maintenance companies","i've never understood how my exurban colleagues' schedules work out. i mean if you add it all up, between kids, errands, and commuting, they lose like 3-4 hours a day.

Felt a lot safer!,"""Minor infractions"" are their words? Because you don't get a ticket unless you're going 11mph over the speed limit.","Depends on the car. If you've got a big payment on it then renting comes out ahead, but if it's paid off then that line item is $0.

I use it almost every weekend at least once to get out to a hobby location (golf, skiing, hiking primarily) and almost never during the week, but I have it when I do need it and also have complete freedom for driving to IAD or BWI or to other cities for day or weekend trips.

Plenty of trails in the area, none of which are particularly low traffic though. Most are pretty full in the evenings and weekends. Locals use the hell out of recreation here. That's not to say it's bad, just something you'll have to get used to.

Pretty much any neighborhood along the Potomac River in VA or DC is recreation heaven and has good access to public transit and downtown. DC tends to have a little more ""nightlife restaurant scene"" than Virginia IMO but both sides have their pluses and minuses. Virginia neighborhoods would be Pentagon City, Potomac Yard, Rosslyn. DC would be Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, District Wharf, Navy Yard. Lots more but that's a start. Either side you have a large community of local bike shops and group rides to choose from if you like that. Potomac pedalers is pretty active.

That's not right. You have to account for the depreciation that comes from simply owning a vehicle that loses value over time, and the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in that depreciating asset, maybe by amortizing the purchase price over the useful life of that car.

If you have $10k tied up in a paid off car that loses $1k per year in value, and you'd be able to earn 5% in an alternative investment, that's essentially an implied cost of $1500/year for continuing to own that car. It's oversimplified, but demonstrates what I'm saying.

So if the cost of car ownership around here is $300/month, that's basically 5 rentals at $60. Maybe you need a car more than 5 days per month, but not everyone does."

There are few intersections, is a straight line. It’s empty yet has a speed camera . It’s a shameless money grab, almost as bad as the military road camera by St. John’s

Edit: I guess my real gripe isn’t the speed camera, it’s the speed limit. 30 is too slow for a road that was built for 35/40. But by using a camera you actually get enforcement of an arbitrary speed limit. The road must be altered to match the speed limit before punishing people for traveling a safe speed that is higher than the posted number.","> Actual cash flow is how I plan

Then just extend out the time frame we're talking about. If you pay $10k in cash once every 10 years to replace your car, that's still cash flow. Or if you get a 5-year car loan once every 10 years, same thing. So instead of saying that I'm renting a car once or twice a month, I'll just say I rent a car 120 to 240 times in that 10-year period, and we're still comparing costs over similar timeframes. Accounting is just a method for making those comparisons, but no matter what, you're still talking about money being spent.

Car ownership is expensive. Renting a car is a potential alternative if your usage style and rate makes that a favorable financial decision, regardless of whether you've paid off the car or not. After all, selling a $10k car that's already been paid off is $10k in positive cash flow right then and there. If budgeting is tight, that can make a huge difference."

I've driven 15,000 miles in the last 5 months, mostly in DC, at all hours, snd biked thousands of miles around the city at all hours. I have a pretty good sense of the traffic patterns. There's often totally empty streets in the middle of the night on weeknights, especially in more residential areas.

And I get that it's meant to be punitive, but there could still be some scale, like a warning for 1st offense, $50 for lower speeds. Higher fines for running reds, etc...

Again, people like you are mad you’re required to go the speed limit. That’s the only thing you’re upset about.","I read through the 19 page PDF technical appendix…So they factor in non-traffic interactions with police, but not crime rates in those census tracts? They posit that the chance of a police encounter makes one less likely to walk, what about the chance of being victimized by a criminal?

So they have all these categories where they say it’s worse for black people, but then they go ahead and add a whole additional metric where the overall scores they’re assigning are pushed higher by a score based solely on having fewer Whites in the census tract? 

Then they factor in disability, but they take it further than the wheelchairs their footnote was citing and score against a neighborhood based on how many people have *any* disability in the broadest sense, and then consider those neighborhoods less walkable?

I’m also still wondering if they factored in pedestrian behavior (beyond intoxication) with respect to tolerance for risk and crossing unlawfully when writing about it racial disparities in pedestrian deaths.

It’s just really interesting to me when you dig down into this stuff, how easy it appears for study authors to goose the results to say whatever they want. Like they added a “farmer’s market score” but as far as I can tell, not a grocery store score. Not that I don’t doubt there are disparities in walkability, but this is an incredibly expansive use of the term."
,"yes, correct.",Lmfaooo
,What does Congress have to do with it?,"Are you referring to the Race Score in the Equity index? They calculated the point difference from the white non-Hispanic city-wide share in a particular census tract (eg a tract is 20% white, it’d have a score of 16) with the reference that less white neighborhoods “have greater exposure to traffic, more pedestrians, and less pedestrian infrastructure.” This seems like double dipping to me considering this is what they’re measuring in DC (an additional metric to measure the same level of under service) but I don’t know enough about walkability literature to truly make that claim.

The whole thing reads like Urban got paid to read some literature and play around in ArcGIS (which is *so much* content that makes it news publications). A better analysis would be “local political inaction that prevents pedestrian infrastructure construction” but that doesn’t make Urban any money and it’s significantly more difficult."
,Under the law that was just passed (I don’t think it has been signed by the mayor yet) you can still renew your license if you have unpaid tickets. I think the only potential penalty is your car being booted.,"Yes that’s what I’m talking about, and double dipping is kinda how I felt."
,"Technically, you could be booted and towed if you owe above a certain amount. However, the towing team is small and it's pretty uncommon that people, even people with $10k+ worth of tickets, get towed.

But, the city won't send delinquents to collections, there's no points system, and you can renew your license even if you've got lots of unpaid tickets.","Urban is, generally speaking, a straight a shooter as it gets in advocacy- a little bent, but not as bad as it could be. That being said, you could do what they do yourself in your choice of GIS environment, it’s not like the data aren’t public.

,"I'd honestly be ok with the law if it were limited to non-moving violations, buuuut it's not because it's easier to pander to idiots that don't want to pay speeding tickets than it is to worry about people dying on the road way.","> It’d be neat to show how layering factors on changes the score, that’s what I tend to do when I probe this stuff.

Eh. Early in my career, I had to read critiques of someone who basically had a cottage industry of making z scores for cities. Almost no city was comparable to each other and each score was basically a scoring for what neighborhoods the city valued (despite the stated purpose of each metric *not* being that). In general, yeah, it’s interesting to see what drives the values in a given tract but I can’t help but feel a little apathetic with these types of analyses."
,"If all you care about is enforcement of the law then sure - creating silly speed traps that catch people that are technically in violation of the law is great. I'd argue that a four lane, 25mph residential thoroughfare is a fundamentally flawed concept that a speeding camera can't possibly fix. I'd also argue than an service road with dog shit signage that forces people exiting the highway to slow from 55mph to 25mph in 50 feet is similarly flawed and won't be fixed by a traffic camera. Furthermore, neither of these areas are particularly dangerous, traffic-wise, so I'd question what problem the city is even trying to address by placing cameras there.

Couple this with the fact that there are areas that automated enforcement could actually make safer (near parks, schools, pedestrian/bike thoroughfares, etc) but they aren't targeted by the city for enforcement because they probably wouldn't generate a huge number of tickets.","Decomposing risk scoring is generally pretty valuable (because if you can figure out how a firm is pricing risk, you can bet against their blind spot), but if I were actually going to build a proper risk score that I trusted I’d look at their inputs and then do an elastic net to see what parameters matter (and how much). My layering method is more to reverse engineer their model, not really test the model quality beyond qualitative judgments."

People have also invented this complete lie that access to public transportation is some sort of luxury for ""wealthy"" and ""cool"" areas. It's totally bizarre.

I live EOTR, but choose to live somewhere convenient to public transportation. I need to use my car often to do basic chores or even to get around the city to meet up with people.

,"Great question. This is what a large body of traffic science revolves around. There is a very popular idea in traffic science called the 85th percentile rule. To use someone elses words ""The Institute of Transportation Engineers defines this as 'the speed at or below which 85 percent of vehicles travel.' In other words, the speed limit on these roads would be set at a free-flowing traffic speed at which only around 15 percent of typical drivers would exceed and violate."" Much of this theory is based on multiple studies which show that basically the majority of drivers, will drive at a speed they feel most comfortable/safe at regardless of the posted speed limit.  [Google scholar can be weird with links but there should be about 10 related studies if you swipe to the right ](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=drive+at+speeds+regardless+of+limits&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&t=1658181753568&u=%23p%3DkSfFbEMJhUEJ).  So if the posted speed limit is way lower than what the average driver would feel is the ideal safe speeds, conditions are created where there are large disparaties in speed. And these disparities are what often lead to accidents and pedestrian deaths. This is a very exaggerated example but imagine if we switched the speed limit on 495 to 10mph or a larger road like Constitution ave NW to 5mph. It may seem to some that this would make things safer. In reality, you would have most cars driving at the actual safest cruising speed and a few others going way slower, essentially creating the formula for a crash. So in short,, it's more that the posted speed limit itself is dangerously slow.

Then again, I'm a transplant with a single Japanese car that we bought new, that's 5+ years old, dinged up, and we'll keep another 10 years or so before the repairs get bad. What do I know?"
,[deleted],"I used to practice at a medical office in SE & did house calls. The lack of easy transportation was a huge issue for many of my elderly/ chronically ill patients. 

I had several patients who required oxygen & carried small portable tanks. There was only  so much O2  they could carry being physically limited to begin with so the time intensive process of taking the bus, Metro Access or walking time made them risk running out of oxygen by the time they arrived at the office much less getting home. Yes, I know oxygen concentrators exist, but many of my patients struggled to get *any* oxygen during COVID even if they had insurance to cover a portable concentrator. 

Snow, cold, or rain was also hazardous and discouraged many from attending visits because waiting at a bus stop is hardly as easy as waiting at a Metro station. 

Those of us who can use alternative methods of transport should since it's unbelievably helpful for the environment, but that's a privilege and we need to consider equity as well when we have these discussions. 

I'll also add that I've done home visits in all parts of DC. SE was by far the most welcoming (and had decent visitor parking)."

,“I am the traffic”,You're not telling us anything we don't already know.  We know the metro doesn't serve large amounts of the city and that's a problem.

,"I blame the highway layout and city design more than people. So much of traffic is caused by shitty merging areas, few major roads, etc. It sometimes feels like DC has not evolved properly like other major US cities to allow for an increase in drivers and traffic. There are definitely some bad drivers here but I ultimately think it’s a layout problem that will be never be solved until they figure out how to efficiently redirect most cross city traffic.","fwiw I think many of us in the anti-car camp recognize how inaccessible transit is for many people - i mean yikes we don't even have a 24-hour system and that in itself perpetuates car culture especially for folks who work early/late shifts. I volunteer somewhere where the shifts start at 7, both for staff and volunteers. On weekends the metro doesn't even open until 7 and so people either have to be lucky enough to live near the bus line, or have to drive. I hate that the infrastructure within the district (or lack there of)

Personally I don't judge individuals who have cars (heck I recently got rid of mine after having it in DC for years), but I do wish that the city was structured and designed in such a way that people didn't have to rely on cars. (take traveling east-west, vice versa, yes there's the bus system which is great, but there should be metrorail systems that connect areas like Cleveland Park to Mt. Pleasant (those are just random examples).

I certainly won't diss folks who rely on their car to survive, but I will criticize the infrastructure in place that makes people think, ""I'm going to drive to the tidal basin instead of taking metro bc that's more convenient (lol)"""
,Who’s gonna tell them? 😂,Thanks for this! Often times people are not considering thr folks who do not have the luxuries of being in close proximity to so many amenities.

Many of us would not consider that to be a form of evolution. The contrary, really.","Having stayed awhile in south east D.C with family, I found it better to use an electric bike in large parts of it, just because of street parking being dangerous and D.C traffic being garbage. Now for family, they need cars, but for singles, maybe a bike would be a better option as it help connects the last few miles to the metro to get wherever you want. This is of course my experience and people may not share it, but it is worth exploring, especially since ebike rebate programs are coming to D.C"
,"Sure, but “driving slower than other traffic” here means at least 65-70 when the speed limit is 55. So should we all drive 80-90 mph or…?","Yuuuuuuup.  Same with NE.  I live 15 minute walk from a metro stop but unless I’m commuting downtown, it doesn’t take me anywhere I really need to go.  And the last mile solutions are basically non-existent.

Not to mention the psychic damage you incur taking it half the time. 

I wish it wasn’t this way.  When I lived in West End I barely used my car.  Walked to pretty much everything I needed.  Now I go through a tank of gas a week, AND incur psychic damage because the drivers here are unhinged.  Sucks.  But I’m in 2500sqft instead of 600sqft for the same price. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

Of course driving somewhere is going to be faster than taking the train. That is the case in most cities. But fact of the matter is, your old Mercedes-Benz is expelling a ton of pollution into the air and you’re creating a danger to pedestrians, so DC shouldn’t be bending over backwards by providing free city parking, etc. You should have to pay for the luxury of driving. Many poor people live in SE DC and can’t afford a Mercedes-Benz."

 Working class folks in most cities and most counties often live outside of city centres, or outside the city altogether while rich folks live in the center of town, or near train stations. At the same time, rich folks are often the ones calling for using less cars, more bikes, and more public transportation to fight climate change, and for other reasons. 

Also, I firmly believe that people who prefer cars over public transportation or bikes should not be apologizing to anyone. This is a free country. This is a capitalist country. You should be able to do whatever you want with the money you earn. I hate public transport. It’s crowded. I hate waiting for the bus or train. You have no control whatsoever. In big cities like D.C. you also end up standing up for almost an hour during rush hour because there aren’t enough seats. What’s the benefit of that? 
And let’s not even start talking about crime, like a couple of friends of mine who got mugged over the years in the subway in nyc or metro in dc.

Hey man, I get where you're coming from, but this is literally the focus of the vast majority of anti-car activism in DC. We believe that it's absolutely not fair that you don't have better options for transportation. That's why we want to increase those options by improving transit, walking, and biking access/ infrastructure. 

That inherently requires building more bike, bus, and other transit lanes, as densifying locations and improving sidewalk experiences. Those things all can't be done without ""taking space away from cars"" since cars get the vast, overwhelming amount of our public space.

We don't blame you for living in a car-dependent area and using a car because you have to. So long as you don't stand in the way when people try to change that reality by adding bike lanes, bus lanes, transit lanes, wider sidewalks, or slower speeds.

The problem here is that many people will use this argument (lots of people have no option other than a car) as an excuse to further entrench the car-centric status quo. That just isn't right."
,,"Did you see this [CNBC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmjde13aGeg)? It covers ""luxury apartments"", mainly in DC, and literally came out yesterday."
,,"This is kind of a strawman complaint though, no?

Anti-car/pro-public transit people aren't advocating that we focus on areas without good public transit access and then ban them from using cars and do nothing else.

The focus is on gradually transforming our infrastructure to make walking/biking/taking public transit far easier and more viable than they are currently, as a way replacing some amount of cars/car infrastructure. But you'd be strategic about how you do it. You wouldn't just leave marginalized/low income people suddenly without a way of getting around.

America is SOOOOOOOOO hyper car oriented right now, we're long overdue for a pushback and public campaign towards fewer cars and more public transportation and walkable/bikable cities. But we're still miles and miles and miles away from a point where we need to be worried that our cities aren't car friendly enough."
,,"I'm in NE. I drive to Herndon everyday for work. The metro takes me two hours, the toll road takes me one. 

Agree with you 100% about needing a car. And I would not move back to Herndon or closer because all the black 20- early something's are in DC or MD. Its not cheaper to have a bike, I've ridden the metro from the Deanwood Station to Wiehle Reston pre silver line expansion and to Innovation Avenue post expansion. 

The metro is as expensive as a car if I'm just going to and from work. $240 a month ( $6 a ride, twice a day, 5x a week), and that only assumes I'm going to 1 building per day and not visiting other sites which I have to. Also doesn't include grocery runs, errands, and the costs of Ubers when I'm staying out late and the metro closes.

Public Transit( Metro,Ubers,) is expensive when you start to add all the totals and you live in NE or SE. People in NW/SW always seem to forget that."

,,"Hmmm..  the reason cars are the “best option” in OP’s case is because that is how the SE was designed.

We design cities and we choose to exclude SE from metro expansions and densification. The answer to that is not to build the city for cars to suit the SE (or Georgetown) but to prioritize public transit"

Given the layout of DC, I'd actually argue that e-bikes are probably a more optimal solution. I know a lot of people in DC use e-scooters as a last mile solution.  

For example, from Georgetown Hospital to Farragut North it's 21 minutes by bus but 14 minutes by conventional bicycle and also 14 minutes by car. It's 2.7 miles bike and 3.0 miles by car. I'd argue an e-bike would be faster than that 14 minutes.  

EDIT: Man it's wild how many people are being rude and attacking me for a simple suggestion. Why this suggestion? Because I grew up poor and I know the value of money to a poor person and I also know how expensive cars are. I'm literally not against disabled people owning cars or taking paratransit, just to clear that up. In fact, a lot of e-bikes have helped disabled veterans FWIW.

I'm talking about the DC Metro here since we're in /r/washingtondc . 

There were 183 assaults in 2021, according to [this.](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc-assaults-on-metro-skyrocketed-in-2021-ridership-plummeted/65-601df0e2-606c-4933-acb7-7b33e8dc1cb7) There were 356 million riders in 2021. Other than aggravated assault, every other crime went down. So out of all the people who ride Metro, it's very unlikely statistically for you to be targeted.  

[Your lifetime chance of death by car is 1/93.](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/preventable-death-overview/odds-of-dying/) If you look at that link, railway passenger was not calculable due to the low number of deaths.  

So in comparison, a car is at least dozens of times more dangerous.  

Besides if you're really that worried, it isn't hard to keep MyMTPD's number to text on your phone, and buy some pepper spray. Pepper spray hurts way more than anything else, but it isn't lethal and permanently damaging so it's more legal.

[Also, it is possible to install a child seat on certain e-bikes.](https://www.ebikingtoday.com/can-you-put-a-child-seat-on-an-electric-bike/)  

A third option is a child trailer. Obviously good bike infrastructure is necessary, but again the possibility is there.  

> need to carry shit with you  

Panniers on a rear rack can carry quite a bit. You can also have a basket in the front on many e-bikes.  

But for bigger hauls there are cargo trailers that can be attached to the rear wheel:  
https://electricbikereport.com/guide-to-electric-bike-trailers/  

I can't find the post right now, but I remember someone lugging a lot on his e-bike, like even 2 packs of La Croix.

Like, you know, before cars, horses existed and we did just fine with them.  

Also just fyi, a lot of people in NYC have carts they bring with them when shopping. They just make more frequent trips, like in Europe. A car isn't the only way to do grocery shopping. People are just used to that as the default.  

The downvotes just prove that people feel any sort of change is an attack on their lifestyle and way of life. I can imagine people saying `HOW DARE YOU!`. But I'm right. Before cars, **horses existed** and people did fine with horses. You don't need cars to carry kids or luggage."

Also. here's the great thing about bikes, when the kids get old enough, they can actually ride their own bike. Eventually they can even do it without you!

To carry stuff you can either: specifically get a cargo bike, or use a bike trailer (like I do for really big grocery trips or large purchases). If it's a really big thing that truly can't fit in either of those, and you can't get it delivered, then you can rent a car for that specific trip. Unless you are moving couches weekly, most people will come out ahead renting a car for those occasions rather than owning a truck for that off chance haul."

My dad spends [$3-4k+ on gas alone.](https://i.imgur.com/BwrXrwZ.png) My dad spends $201/month on insurance.  

The average American spends $150-200 on gas per month. The average cost of full coverage is $168 per month. That's $318/month going down the drain each month when that would be $0/month with an e-bike. Well, the charging cost is not $0 exactly, but I've calculated and if I charged 0-100 everyday for a year for 640 Wh, that would be like $16. 

That's not to mention the cost of maintenance. I remember maintenance for my dad's 2017 Jeep Patriot cost over $2k at one point.  

If we are talking about money, owning a car is 100% more expensive than owning an e-bike. So it's not elitist at all. If we want to help people spend less money and also help the environment, we should 100% be encouraging e-bikes and e-scooters and public transportation."

Have never gone past bethesda/dtss, or anywhere in PG, and who B. Just outright reject that the suburbs *aren't* a blank slate or completely homogenous by county.

If it's wrong to believe that you should have a certain income level to become a parent, then so be it. But I'm pretty sure adoption agencies have those sorts of checks to them.  

> You're basically telling someone they shouldn't have had kids so they could rely on public transportation.   

I'm saying that having a child is pretty much the biggest way to increase your carbon footprint. It's not just about public transportation. Increasing carbon footprint in general is bad for the planet.  

And either way, if you want to have kids, it's bad to raise kids in a place where they can't have freedom and independence. [Why We Won't Raise Kids in Suburbia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHlpmxLTxpw) Like can any of you say that your kids have a better experience than what's shown in that video? NYC is probably the single place that's comparable.   

You know you have a crappy car-dependent life, and you might even be poor (which are a lot of people are claiming in this thread), and you bring a kid into that? It's just not cool.  

I grew up poor and I suffered a lot because of that. I didn't get to participate in other things people did, like trading Pokemon cards because we were poor and I knew I had hand-me-down clothes from my older brother. I remember I never attended any afterschool events in elementary school, even mandatory ones, because my mom never drove me there. If the distance was shorter, I probably would have just walked there myself as a kid.  

This was a long rant but the **TL;DR** is if you're going to have kids you should provide the best experiences for them. And raising them in car-dependent suburbia is not providing the best experience for them.  

I can say I would have rather lived in a walkable area of NYC as a kid rather than suburbia where you must have a car. Honestly back when I was growing up, the Ride-On bus coverage was quite poor and it's come a long way since then.

SF is expensive because of Silicon Valley. Most of the wealthiest folks in SF work OUTSIDE of the city in Mountain View (Google) or Cupertino (Apple) or Menlo Park (Facebook) or Palo Alto and have major commutes. SF wasn't always this expensive - its wealth grew with major structural shifts in the economy that exploded the tech industry in the last 20 years.

Absolutely stunning . The largest grouping of Cherry Blossoms on Dorset Ave and side Streets"
,,"Agree with Georgetown, and adding Brookmont, in Bethesda off MacArthur Blvd."
,,100% agree on this. Mass Avenue to Lincoln park and then east Capitol to the Capitol is one of my favorite walks. Also start at senate park outside union station before going down mass av since there are some nice blossoms there too
,,Ooo any cherry trees among those trees? I’m visiting tmrw to catch the blooms!
,,I’m sneezing just looking at this map.
,,Wow! DC is filled with cherry trees. Any particular areas/neighborhoods besides the Tidal Basin that you know of that are super worth checking out?

,,Surprised that no one has mentioned this yet but Old Town Alexandria would be my first choice
,,"These aren't ""favorites"" per se but I have a rundown:

1. Frederick: Pretty sizeable (similar to Old Town in that way) so lots of options and its a shame the Brunswick line isn't more feasible.
2. Annapolis: The waterfront is nice but the sprawl immediately around there is real bad and the historic core is smaller.
3. Hagerstown: you start to stretch the definition of 'near' DC here but the city is pretty sizeable which surprised me however it's fairly run down. You can see the difference distance-to-dc makes between here and Frederick.
4. Ellicott City: Very small but worth a visit if you're in the Baltimore area.
5. Winchester: In between Frederick and Hagerstown (literally, too).
6. Culpepper: you can take the train! Not very big but the downtown is pretty bustling every time I've been.
7. Warrenton: a little bigger and a little closer than Culpepper but yet seems to have less on offer.
8. Fredericksburg: the college nearby helps and while it doesn't really have a classic ""waterfront"" like Annapolis does that does help a bit. It's just getting there that's a pain.
9. Harper's Ferry: Beautiful scenery but actually very small.
10. Brunswick: bigger town than you'd think for how low-key things are.
11. Lovettsville: Higher home values than Brunswick but smaller core. But they're doing a really good job building up that area to not just be suburban sprawl. Will be neat to see it like 10 years.
12. Leesburg: Once you actually get past all the 7/15 traffic you can have a nice time.
13. Purcellville: notable for being at the end of the W&OD. Probably breaks a record for breweries per square mile.
14. Manassas:  A lot of potential and what's there isn't too bad but one thing I do hate about these historic downtowns also being county seats is the way the local courthouse just absolutely kills a big chunk of what could be nice. If you're gonna have a super-admin complex at least make it work with the street better.
15. Fairfax: see above.
16. Towson: Far but a nice walkable suburban addition to Baltimore.
17. Sheperdstown WV: does a better job of what you might think Harper's Ferry does when it comes to being an actual town.
18. Waterford/Hillsboro/Hamilton/Clifton/Boonsboro/Point of Rocks/Middleburg/Marshall/Sperryville/Washington (VA)/Occoquan: I lump these together because they're not much more than a street or two but they are interesting enough to detour off the main road if you're interested.
19. Front Royal: again fairly wasted potential compared to Winchester up the road.

A couple more: 

1. Chesapeake Beach: again very small but nice for a day trip. 
2. Might as well explicitly mention Richmond and Baltimore if you haven't actually visited yet but they're big enough that they have multiple nodes within those cities. 
3. Easton/Cambridge on the eastern shore if you can handle the bay bridge traffic. 
4. Harvre de Grace north of Baltimore. 
5. Catonsville has a small historic downtown completely surrounded by inner suburbs of Baltimore but its there. Less so in Glen Burnie."
,,depends on how near we're talking but downtown Ellicott City is pretty cute.
,,"Shepherdstown, WV."
,,"Cumberland is small, but I think all the water around it makes it really pretty."
,,"Those places all have walkable downtowns, but it's still a challenge to live car-free there as things like grocery stores and the like aren't in the walkable core. I lived in Frederick and visited Harper's Ferry a lot. Both have great downtowns, but you can't live there car free like DC. Transit is terrible, and the road surroundings are high speed stroads that are dangerous to bike on or even across.

I live car-free day-to-day, but I moved from Frederick to DC to do so."

It's not at the level of some of the other cities/towns mentioned and you have to have a car if you were to live there, but the downtown area is super cool and walkable. Give it a few years and it will start to be mentioned more and more in lists like these."

,,"Colonial Williamsburg, VA. Not sure about living there, but it's fun to visit."
,,Occoquan is pretty neat
,,"There are a lot of neighborhoods in Baltimore you can live car free if you want. Fells Point, Fed Hill, Riverside, Charles Village, Hampden. Really most of the rowhouse neighborhoods in the city you could do it. Though it would be difficult leaving the neighborhood, so you might need a car for occasional trips out. But if you lived along the light rail you can get to a lot of spots without a car easily."

,,"I think the charm of this area is how many ""one horse towns"" there are hidden across the suburban hell scape. Falls Church is a little bigger, but there is a brick paved part of E Broad St. Westover between there and Arlington is also adorable. Brookville in Chevy Chase legitimately feels one horse. Takoma Park is gorgeous. The list goes on and on."
,,"For a bunch of people who don't seem to care about borders very much, you all seem to care A LOT about borders."

,,"Live just south of Old Town and it's incredibly walkable. Plenty of Bikeshare stations as well, so you can cover a lot of ground. You can even bike to Del Ray which is also a nice walkable community."

,,Highly recommend Chestertown which for my money is one of the quaintest towns reachable from DC. It is an outstanding town.
,,Surprised you left out Middleburg
,,It's quaint as fuck. I absolutely love downtown EC and Catonsville.
,,"I agree that Ellicott City is pretty cool. I went there for the first time with my wife a few years ago and we were really taken by it. After dinner there it started to rain as we were walking to our car. Later that night we saw on the news that a couple hours later the whole area where we had been walking that day was underwater with people trapped in buildings and getting washed away. It was crazy. Then they had another similar flood a couple years later. Cute town, but they have to fix that drainage problem."
,,"Went there randomly after a day trip to Antietam (because there wasn't much in the actual town of Sharpsburg) and had a very pleasant time. I guess the college being there helps. 

If I didn't have my exhausted and sticky kids (from ice cream down the block) I would have liked to peruse the record shop."
,,"Huge drugs problem there, though. Not a good place to live."
,,"It's been 3 years, but I didn't get a good feeling or enough to make it a recommended, walkable down town.  It seemed like they were still stuck in coal mining days."

,,"> I think most people consider that part of DC the same way Bethesda, Silver Spring, and Arlington are.

If by ""most people"" you mean ""nearly nobody""."
,,Most people = Transplants and People who never lived in DC...
,,"LOL, no. I grew up in Arlington county and nobody ever said they were from DC. If you were talking to someone from outside the region you would say either Northern VA or outside DC. Maybe transplants tend to say that, but its not really a thing for long term residents, I imagine its the same for the other inner suburbs."
,,"I'm honestly surprised that comment got so upvoted, I honestly didn't think many people (period but especially on DC) were familiar with it, but it really is! the train museum is imo the definition of quaint."
,,"The issue in Ellicott City is that it’s at the bottom of a stream valley, and there was way too much development with massive amounts of pavement built upstream, so water that would normally seep into the ground was being funneled directly towards EC. The derisively nicknamed “rain tax” that was passed near the end of O’Malley’s second term would have helped mitigate this, as impermeable surfaces would be taxed with revenue going to storm water management. Hogan pushed for a full repeal as part of his first campaign, and while it wasn’t fully repealed, it was neutered to the point that it become completely meaningless."
,,"Grew up in that area. They voted out the old County Exec and brought in a new one who worked with community and businesses to implement flood control. Haven’t had flooding issues to that extent since - not to say it won’t happen, but there has been a cognizant effort since Calvin Ball came in to do appropriate flood and emergency control. 

I’d also say if you go to OEC doing the drive to Catonsville is also nice."
,,"Admiral Analog's has a great selection. If you like wine, I also highly recommend Grapes and Grains - every single person there knows their wine, they have a great selection, and they will recommend something really great. I regularly walk in and tell them the flavor profile I've been craving and they point me to something new (to me) and perfect. Love them"
,,The biggest thing lacking in DTA is grocery access. There's basically nothing convenient without having a car.

If you live in Middleburg proper, you have a grocery store, pharmacy, bars, restaurants, a post office, a pool, a library, a hardware store, several churches, a couple of banks, and lots of boutiques all within easy walking distance. If you work from home, you can easily accomplish most of your daily tasks without needing to hop into a car."
,,Food recs please? Pretty please?
,,yeah the old town is so cute
,,LOL as someone who grew up near Williamsburg I concur. I LOATHED when my parents would have guests and we'd take them to Williamsburg. It's cool to visit for a school field trip or if you're REALLY into American History but it's not a fun place to hangout or live. All the restaurants are old school fancy like something your grandparents would enjoy. There's nothing hip or cool for even adults in their 30's and 40's. The only thing fun in Williamsburg is Busch Gardens.
,,"I mean if you want to sit in one spot and listen to music at the pavilion and get a bite to eat or drink, sure, it's fine, but it's just one not very long street, E. Main, just one strip of restaurants and a couple of shops.  I always leave feeling like we missed half of it or something, especially if we didn't drive to Monticello or a winery earlier in the day.  It's probably also the fact it takes about 2.5-3.5+ hours to drive there on a Saturday, depends on what I95 looks like, so that's 5-7 hours of drive time for four short blocks of a few restaurants, CVS, a couple of shops, and a pavilion, and I'm being honest here and offer that I know art is subjective, but I've yet to have enjoyed anything I've watched/heard enough to stay longer than 15 minutes.  If it was closer I'd think it was great, but it's not."

Also I don't know where you're coming from but it's 2 hours from DC. You get off 66 at Gainesville and take 29 all the way down. Once there you are a short drive from mountains, wineries, swimming lakes, and of course tons of history. It's impossible to be bored in Charlottesville."
,,"And once they made it free, believe it or not, service improved tremendously. The more traveled routes come every 15 minutes all day. Around both rush hours the Duke Street one comes every 10. Oh and they added a lot of electric busses. It's /so/ much easier to breathe in those no lie."
,,The price is a little steep to use that reliably as transit.
,,">Alexandria and Arlington only exist as such because they were literally part of DC.

Like seriously, read a book or something. Alexandria was founded in 1749. In fact, DC was created in large part because of the presence of Alexandria (and Georgetown, which also predates DC)."
,,"No
What you said doesn't just correlate to this post and each of those places are its own individual cities. 

I know plenty if people who are from DC and the greater metro area who never walked or really explored those stated areas."
,,"Not really, it is arbitrary but going to Arlington is a very different from going to Tenleytown or Adams Morgan or Eastern Market, and growing up heading into DC felt substantially different from going to Ballston, or Westover, or even Falls Church. They are not the same town, there are a lot of cultural differences. 

I wouldn't recommend Arlington or Silver Spring for a day trip from DC, but since there isn't really anything to do in either place that you couldn't find somewhere in the city, but anyone who considers them to actually be part of DC is showing they don't really understand the region."

,,“As such” - the borders and modern political entities of Alexandria and Arlington are a direct result of their inclusion and later separation from DC. I’d tell you that maybe you should be the one to read a book but you can’t even properly read a Reddit comment so that might be hard for you
,,"The post mentions Frederick, Charlottesville, and Anapolis - places that are distinct incorporated cities not on the DC metro system. Anyone with a brain can understand that this person lives in DC and wants to know about other, fully separate downtowns. Yes technically Bethesda and Old Town are “not” DC we all know this, but for all intents and purposes they are because you can take the metro from one to the other. The greater metro area goes so so far beyond these inner burbs, which directly border DC. If you live in Gan Ness, downtown Bethesda is your closest “downtown”, samw with Silver Spring and Brightwood, Takoma and Takoma Park, Arlington and Georgetown, etc etc. 

You’re being incredibly pretentious and are up on a high horse about nothing when the post is specifically about cities that are not DC with walkable downtowns. Nobody is saying that Bethesda is part of DC but if you live in DC going to Bethesda or Old Town is staying in town, nobody in their right mind would say they were going out of town if they went to old town but they definitely would if they went to Charlottesville"
,,"If you live in various parts of DC, the downtown of Bethesda, Arlington, or Silver Spring would easily be the closest ""downtown"" central district. And sure as a child those felt like vastly different places to you, because you were a child and didn't have a sense of how close it all was. I'm sure children EOTR feel the same way when they go to the Zoo. 

And if we're defining things by cultural differences, Bethesda and Arlington are much closer culturally to the traditionally affluent parts of DC west of the park than those DC neighborhoods are to anywhere EOTR"

For example, let's say you're currently living in Arlington, and you tell a friend, ""I'm thinking about moving to DC."" They will understand that although you already live in the ""DC area,"" you are considering moving within the city limits. Other terms often used when referring to the city-proper include ""the district,"" ""the city,"" and ""downtown.""

If you're living in Texas and you tell a fellow Texan friend that you're moving to ""DC,"" sure, that could be inclusive of Arlington/Alexandria/Fairfax/PG/etc. Context is important.

Now maybe the question **was** about areas outside the metro area but not too far outside. The examples provided do mostly line up with that interpretation, although I'd consider Frederick part of the Washington, DC metro (nasty commute though)."

Herndon has a very very small wetlands preserve near it. South side, just west of the station. Might be hard to access due to construction. The station is also a mile or so south of old town Herndon, which has civic buildings, restaurants, and a brewery.


Innovation Center doesn't have much of note right now. Lots of apartments, townhomes, and airport hotels. There are a couple restaurants a block from the south entrance. Arrowbrook Center is a little less than a mile away, with a large sports park.


The airport stop only has an airport. Nothing else there.

,,"Happy to help. Reston Town Center is about a 5 minute walk from the station. Has a bunch of shops, restaurants, plazas, etc.. it's certainly worth checking out if you've never been."
,,"The 331/332 bus will service One Loudoun but very infrequently. I would not rely on it.

Loudoun County's bus system is very sorry."

,,"United used to have a partnership with Amtrak where they would sell ""flights"" from the Philadelphia train station to Newark, which were actually just a train. It was actually pretty sweet, an 80-mile connecting flight on a tiny plane is incredibly annoying and wasteful, and because the train was ticketed like a flight, you were protected if Amtrak caused you to miss a connection."
,,Eh....there isn't anything particularly special about Reston Town Center.  Least nothing I'd consider being worth going out of someone's way to go to.  But if you have to pick a place to go on the new section of Silver that isn't the airport it's probably the best bet.
,,"It has been so hard coded in my brain to ignore the RTC metro station (and the other five…) that, even knowing I am reading comments about it finally opening, my mind still defaulted to thinking you were talking about Wiehle-Reston East. I was about to reply saying that is definitely not a five-minute walk. Lol."
,,That's really cool! And you probably got United miles for it too.
,,"yeah it's a collection of the most corporate chain restaurants and shops. i don't think there's anything there that isn't at Tysons 15m of metro ahead of it, where you get more options and somehow still cheaper"
,,"Around DC: 

1. Arlington, particularly around the metro stations. 
2. Alexandria: old town, del ray, arlandria if you can't afford those spots. 
3. Bethesda, Rockville, or Silver Spring in MoCo but those three areas cover a lot of distance so you have to be specific about where in those areas but again, close to the metro. 
4. Hyattsville or College Park in PG County. 

Note: for all those the term ""suburb"" doesn't really apply except in the sense that it's not in DC. There are areas inside DC proper that definitely feel more suburban than all those places. 

Around Baltimore you have Towson and probably others but I'm not as familiar. "
,,"Silver Spring, by a huge margin.

Within ~3 blocks of downtown Silver Spring (and the metro station) is:

- A pedestrian street with a fountain next to an indoor mall (feat. Dave & Busters)
- An ice skating rink
- Two movie theaters, including the American Film Institute theater (with alcohol!)
- Two Breweries, soon to be three
- The Fillmore music venue
- Dozens of bars (Quarry House!) and Restaurants
- Three live performance theaters (plays+comedy)
- A new beautiful library with 3D printing, also containing the Levine School of Music
- an American Legion with shows/comedy
- The B&O Railroad station and museum
- *literally* the best Ethiopian restaurants in the country
- The NOAA wave pool fountain (awesome in the summer) and the Dinosaurs at the Discovery Building (but those are going away, sadly)
- Walking/bike paths directly connecting to Sligo Creek and the trail that leads all around DC
- Friends of the Library used book store (great for browsing), next to a dog park (walking... for *dogs*)
- and literally every store and service you could possibly need"
,,"/u/madmoneymcgee had it right. 

I would just add for 2,3, and 4 around the metro stations as they specified for Arlington. 

All of the areas have far flung non-walkable areas. 

On top of that there is the city of falls church which is walkable but boring as /u/madmoneymcgee also pointed out. I guess we can add in the Mosaic district too, and Reston down center, they are walkable but isolated and there isnt much to do. I suppose wheaton could also be added. "
,,"Depending on your priorities maybe consider West Falls Church. Cheaper and less developed than Arlington or Silver Spring. Less nightlife but lots of shops, restaurants, and green space. Convenient to Metro, 66, and the W&OD. "
,,"Merrifield at Dunn Loring station is completely walkable to dog parks, grocery stores, salons, dry cleaners, too many to count restaurants, drs., dentists, stores in Mosaic inculding Target, a movie theater and farmers market. "
,,"DC - Bethesda, Arlington, Old Town Alexandria

Baltimore - Towson, Downtown Catonsville, Old Ellicott City (they are working on rebuilding after the disastrous flooding, still worth checking out)"
,,"I’ve lived in both downtown Bethesda and downtown Silver Spring. Both are very walkable but definitely have different vibes. To me, Bethesda felt more like a town to me whereas Silver Spring felt more like a neighborhood in DC even though its outside the city. The walkable area of Bethesda is bigger and had more things to do,  but in Silver Spring everything you need is within a few blocks. I also think Bethesda felt a little more family oriented. 


FWIW, I think you’ll find suburban feeling neighborhoods in DC. I live in Van Ness, which is pretty quiet and feels a bit suburban at times. While there’s less to do in Van Ness than Bethesda or Silver Spring it is a lot easier to get to other areas of DC. "
,,"I’m not sure if this is what you are looking for, but there is a joke that Baltimore itself is a suburb of DC. Speaking to south Baltimore in particular - The daily commute to DC is easy, there are a few neighborhoods close to a MARC station. There’s a dog park at Latrobe, other parks for the pups are Riverside, Federal Hill, and Fort McHenry, basically you will be near a dog friendly park. There are great restaurants/bars/shops within walking distance, and the grocery stores are walkable, or in the alternative deliver. Short walk to inner harbor, which is also a great walk with pups, and the rest of the city is just a quick walk or Uber away. This might not be exactly what you were looking for but as I mentioned previously, it is somewhat of a joke that Baltimore is a suburb of DC. The commute is easy, COL is better, and the general atmosphere is pretty laid back. Regardless, best of luck in your search!

As someone with similar desires as you, I would recommend trying to just rent an apartment/house as close to your work as possible (as long as you work in DC) and just spend the extra money for at least a year to “try out” the area, while simultaneously having a really easy commute and the extra free time that brings."

But if you’ve never done it before (many haven’t), living within walking distance to your work is one of the greatest and most underrated things in the world — and it’s possible in DC, unlike most places.  You get a neighborhood and get to experience it on foot every day.

You can always live in the suburbs later."

Sure, but I come out wayyyy ahead with no car payments, insurance payments, maintenance costs, etc. I have a bike and metro and that’s all I’ve ever needed. I can’t even remember the last time I Ubered. 

In terms of quality of life, I love the diversity of DC, but I love the diversity that’s within walking distance for me. I can walk to just about any type of bar/restaurant/cuisine I could imagine. 

Are there things I’d change? Definitely, but I can’t imagine living in another US city and being as happy as I am here."
,,"I’m originally from California, but I lived in Philly for 7 years before moving to DC. I’ve been in DC for 2.5 years now and just bought a condo, so planning on staying for the long haul. 

I love all the culture that DC has to offer. There are so many museums, theaters, and other points of interest here. It’s awesome to walk to the National Mall in the evening, grab some food from a food truck, and just sit and enjoy all the scenery. Not to say Philly doesn’t have any of this, because of course it does, but not on the same scale as DC. 

The job market here is profoundly better. I struggled to find good jobs in Philly. My salary in Philly topped out at $52k. I’ve more than doubled my salary since moving, and yes, the COL is higher here, but not 2x as expensive. For comparison, rent in Philly was $2,000 vs $2,400 here for very similar apartment buildings. My husband also got a huge pay bump when we moved here (though not quite as drastic as mine), so overall we are in a much more comfortable place financially even though it’s a little more expensive. Also, the pure number of job opportunities here is staggering compared to Philly, at least in my field.

I also prefer the diversity of DC. There are people here from all over the country and world. I like that I meet tons of other people from California, for example. I feel like less of an outsider here because so few of the people I work with and have become friends with are from here. Philly has a really intense local culture that I never grew to enjoy. 

In Philly’s favor, the restaurant scene there is a lot better. DC has decent restaurants, but Philly was a foodie heaven. One of my favorite things about going back to Philly is going to as many restaurants as possible. 

Do I ever miss Philly? Oh, yeah! I miss walking around University City when all the students return and it’s buzzing with excitement. I miss the cobblestone streets of Old City and walking through Elfreth’s Alley to get home. I miss the friends I made there, Reading Terminal Market, the German Christmas Village in December, Penn’s Landing in the summer, and the proximity to NYC. I miss how well I knew my way around by the end of 7 years. But it’s just a short train ride away, and I go back and visit often enough (well, I did pre-pandemic) to get my fix. 

TBH, I think both are great places to live and which to live in just depends on what you value most."
,,"This isn't want you wanted to hear, but TBH, if I had a work opportunity in Philadelphia, and plenty of friends and family there, I would move to Philly in a heartbeat. It's an awesome town, there's nothing better than being near the people you love, and you'll save a boatload of money. And I say this as someone who loves DC!

DC's not going anywhere without you. Get Amtrak deals and come to DC any Saturday you want for $60. You'll still save money."
,,"Caveating that my experience has been that I moved here to work in politics and have worked in that field for over a decade. For that, greatest place in the US. The way people think here, how worldly it is, how you can go from a National Brewers reception to a French Embassy party and tuck into a conversation on global vaccine distribution. Can’t get that in Philly. 

For everything else, huge fan. Great coffee, easy to get around, excellent food. Not quite as “a little slice of everything” as New York, but you can find a niche or a group that fits who you are pretty easily. COVID makes that a little harder, but that’ll change. 

I’d say the two are just as neighborhood-y. You hang out where you live mostly. I’ve lived in the Capitol Hill neighborhood for the entirety, and it’s awesome. I had Eastern Market, Barracks Row and H St when I was a more booze and dating driven youngster. Now, I have a close daycare, a quiet neighborhood (always had it here), and I can still booze with buddies. Nats Park is a 5~ minute drive away. 

However, I’ll say this. Whatever you decide, when you look back in ten years, it’ll be the people that you will remember fondly. The things you did, the jokes you shared. Places fit into that, but matter less."
,,"Lived in Philly from '97 to 2000; DC 2014-2016 and 2020 to present. My take is mostly about the flavor of each city, the feeling of moving through it, the buildings, the urban spaces, etc.

Philly is rugged. Their sports mascot is called Gritty for good reason. It has endless blocks of historic buildings -- gorgeous Victorian rowhouses and twins that just go on and on and on for miles. In all of South Philly there are practically no trees. North Philly has substantial areas of deep poverty, with countless abandoned houses, many of them utterly beautiful. It has tremendous untapped potential. It has huge post-industrial brownfields and ruins and active industrial sites. The city is famous as the heart of Colonial America but it's really an Industrial Age city that exploded outwards after the Civil War. It tends toward the Gothic, the overwrought Queen Anne, the blue collar. Its most thriving areas -- the core of Center City, South Street, the general UPenn area, Manayunk -- aren't well connected to each other but are sometimes shocking with their levels of East Coast bustle. I lived in West Philly near Clark Park and felt wonderfully comfortable, nestled in a cozy neighborhood with lots happening around me. 

DC is polished. The historic core is quite small, and it runs out into suburban-style development with shocking speed. There are very few abandoned buildings here, and certainly no neighborhoods at a level of decay comparable to, say, Erie Ave or Lehigh Ave in Philly. Everything here has been developed or redeveloped. The streets are mostly alive and feel comfortable and safe, if a bit bland sometimes. Things are leafy and green. Many of the most active spots are connected -- 17th Street, U Street, 14th Street. The physical geography of your life will be a lot smaller here. The city is all about its founding era history; the architecture is dominated by the Federal, the Classical, Greek, and Colonial Revival -- though gorgeous Italianate made some serious inroads after the Civil War.

They both have deep history, astonishingly huge city parks (Wissahickon Valley and Rock Creek are remarkably similar parks), a lot going on, good rail connections to other cities, transit systems that could be okay if they'd sink serious rehab money into them. Both great cities. Tough choice. Good luck!!"
,,"Among other things, I really appreciate the weather here. Winters can be tough, but it definitely is a place with four distinct seasons and spring and fall seasons are FANTASTIC, imo.

Also, the diversity of experiences you can have in the region are really great. Want mountains? We got it. Beaches? Not too far away. Train rides to other major cities, or direct plane rides to Europe? Yup. Or maybe you want quieter countryside. That's around here too. It's quite nice to have all of that on-hand."
,,"Don’t underestimate the importance of where all of your family and friends live! DC is great, but moving here without knowing many folks would be kinda tough even without an ongoing pandemic."
,,"Dc is a networking rich city - when things open back up and you want to make contacts in your field, this is a pretty neat area to do that. That can apply to a ton of industries too. So if it’s possible I’d save some money and do Philly for a hot minute with an eye to DC a year from now."
,,"My wife and I just moved here in May for her new job and here are some of the things I love after moving here from Texas:

-The weather is much better.  DC Summer is hot, but its not Texas hot.  DC is humid for sure, But there were cool days here in the Summer that I didn't get before.  Fall weather has been AMAZING so far.  

-Always something to do.  There's just always something going on and something to go see.  We've visited a ton of museums and still have many to go to.  

-The food here is pretty damn good.  I definitely miss TX bbq and TexMex (hard AF to find a good flour tortilla here) but overall there is a ton of good food around here.

-The Metro is dope.  Well, when its working normally.

Now, what I don't like

-Takes 1309483094830438 years to go 1 mile here in a car

-Streets are absolutely the worst I've ever encountered in my life.  I swear I can hear my car's suspension crying out in pain."
,,"Hi chiming in bc I haven’t heard others mention it, but DC is also a much more international city than Philly. Think of all the Embassies here and events they have, the huge diaspora communities around the area (and the bomb food that comes along with it!). 

It sounds to me like you’re debating whether or not to take a leap outside your comfort zone (assuming Philly is home) and if that’s the case move here! If you hate you go back no big deal but give yourself the experience to grow! 

And hit up the thread when you move I bet lots of folks will take you out for a beer and show you around :)"

,,"I’ve lived in both and prefer DC any day. Super classy city — underrated night scene — I mean spring time is the best walking around DuPont circle or U Street getting a drink or coffee. Well dressed city, so much to do when friends visit with the museums and monuments. While I love Philly for the people being super prideful about their city it’s a bit too rugged for my taste. Buildings too condensed; I don’t feel comfortable walking with a friend at night in certain neighborhoods even for something convenient like getting something from my car. Literally Philly’s pricing for rent is awesome, better sports down than dc and has a great aura around it. But DC wins easily. My roommates have said the same"
,,"Having lived in both my entire life, the people in DC are wayyyyyy friendlier.  I could easily start a conversation with a stranger here but in Philly you’ll be told to fuck off.

Once you get out of Philly, it’s suburban hell in both NJ and PA.  Within a 30 minute drive there isn’t much to do other than go to king of Prussia mall.

Dc is consistently rated number one for parks.   You can disappear in rock creek park and Roosevelt island and see deer and not even feel like you’re in the city.

Philly has some history, but it’s pretty much just the liberty bell and the events around that.  DC has sooo much variety in history, cultures, and FOOD.  Philly has good food, but not in the same way we have it here.  They may have one or two pho places.  We have 266284949382 of them.  

There is a much broader variety of people as well.  Philly is relatively segregated and while there are other cultures it’s basically black/white.  You (at least if you’re not from the culture) have to search for it.  Here is everywhere.   I’ve met someone from every country in Africa for example.  In Jersey the whitest fuckers on the planet think being “Italian” is ethnic, never been to Italy, don’t speak the language and maybe, maybe their great great grandfather immigrated here from Italy.

It’s not like that here at all.  Other than the interns on the hill that come here to “make a difference” before getting burnt out, people here are pretty genuine, authentic and friendly.

In Philly I’d consider it a good day if I managed to take a walk and not run into a homeless dude masturbating on the sidewalk"
,,"I moved here from Philly for a job, and honestly I still really miss it. If I was able to choose to go back, I probably would (and I still really like DC). Of course, it's the first city I lived in post-grad, and a bunch of my time in DC has been marred by the pandemic, but still. There's a lot of charm I miss, and considering you already know a lot of people there, that swings it even more in your favor. That doesn't even touch the rent discrepancy (Though I guess I get paid more comparably? It's hard to tell.)

I will say that if you to decide to move to DC, I doubt you'll hate it, but I just have such a soft spot in my heart for Philly. But it might help if you share what attracts you to DC over Philly or vice versa."
,,"DC is way cleaner. People from both cities tend to be abrasive/rude unless you look like you belong in their social class. Philly has bangin food, although DC has stepped it up big time over the past decade and outside of Baltimore I wouldn’t get seafood anywhere else. Both cities have the Big Four sports teams. Work-wise both are major hubs for pretty much any industry you care to work in, the opportunities are huge. DC’s only advantage comes in if you’re in the political field. WMATA fucking blows, SEPTA is way better but all of my Philly friends claim we have it good when they visit. Grass is greener, I guess. I liked Philly’s nightlife a lot. DC’s feels more pretentious but maybe that’s because of where I go. 

All in all neither are the best city in the world but I’d rather live in either than most other places."
,,"In a sentence, DC is an easily walkable city with a million things to do for free."
,,"I love Philly! Honestly, I'd move there."
,,I like how many people dress like they’re the main character in a John Grisham novel.

,,"If I worked remotely and didn't care about job market and all my friends and family lived in Philly, I'd go there.  Unless I was already from Philly and young in which case I'd move somewhere else like abroad or the west coast.  Otherwise I'd choose DC (Arlington), even though I also work remotely, because it's safer and cleaner with much better public transit.  I'd rather live in a more democratic state (DC, VA, MD) with laws that better protect me as woman.  The fact that Philly/PA still allows smoking and the sale of cigarettes in bars was actually a big factor in me deciding not to move there.  I think it speaks volumes.  Oh and legalized marijuana in DC and VA."
,,[deleted]
,,"I grew up around Philly and I've been here for about 5 years. 

I'm biased, I'm very very biased. I will get that out of the way right now.

I would go to Philly. ESPECIALLY if you have friends and family there. Philly is the kind of town that is made 100x better by having friends and family even if it's awesome on it's own. It's also way cheaper and in my opinion has a much better food culture (which is a thing for me, idk about you). People can fight me on that but I'll take Reading Terminal or any hole in the wall cheesesteak place over the 100th Ethiopian restaurant any day of the week. Additionally if you are a football or hockey fan Philly is a much more fun place to be. Cost of living is way cheaper up there and the summers/spring are not quite as brutal.

So yea, admitting my own bias, I would prefer Philly over DC and if you have friends there I definitely suggest you go Philly. Making friends as an adult is not easy. I won't say Philly is any better because I've never had that experience, but it wasn't and continues to be difficult here (although that might just be part of making friends as an adult being difficult in general)"
,,"Honestly, if I was starting right from ground zero between DC and Philly, I'd pick Philly. It's cheaper and closer to NYC. 

What I like most about DC is the cast of interesting people I've met here. But you can meet great people anywhere. I had to move to DC for a job several years ago, but have been staying around for the people."
,,"I've lived in both Philly and DC, although Philly for years longer. I miss the grit and down-to-earthness of Philly. Luckily the train ride is quick and easy to get up there - the drive can be trafficky and long at times. The idea of homeownership is also something actually attainable in Philadelphia. Philly also has a sense of community, something I have not found here in DC. Most of my friends in Philly own their places and it really is so nice to be able to walk a few blocks and pop in on your friends (whether they like it or not). The food scene is one of my favorite in the country as well and also affordable. I miss Philly...if I could move my job from DC to there, I would."
,,"Have not lived in Philly, but have family there and between that, occasionally work, and various other events, I've been there a lot.

I guess this is less selling you on DC and more... well, shitting on Philly. Sorry Philly.

DC is basically Philly but clean. DC has most of the conveniences of a big city without having to actually be in a big city. It's difficult to drive in DC; it's impossible in Philly. (In either place you should get a bike, though.) Philly is dirtier, Philly has more (and more aggressive) homeless. And for that matter hookers; I can't remember the last time I saw a hooker in DC. I was in Philly a couple of months ago and decided to go for a walk around 9pm. In gym shorts, a tank top, and sandals I apparently looked like I was looking for a good time.

We've got historic buildings, and you can actually tour pretty much any of them. We have monuments, we have parks, we have the current goings-on of democracy. And we have sidewalks you can actually walk on and streets you can actually drive on.

DC has a certain indefinable quality. If a thing is going to happen, it will happen here. There was recently this ground-breaking VR experience that only had about 8 locations across the country. I believe there was one in NYC. There was not one in Philly. They opened a storefront for it in DC. Not that DC is any bigger, or wealthier, than Philly. It's just... the place things happen.

Pretty much any advantage Philly might have, DC has more. You can find a place in one of our suburbs where the rent is much cheaper and still be a relatively quick metro ride from anything you might want to get to in the city. Granted out metro sucks but again, I've been on mass transit in Philly, and as bad as DC is, ""better than Philly"" is a low bar to get over.

Anyway. Sorry if I sound like a jackass harshing on Philly, it's sorta my point, though. It's not really that DC itself is especially amazing, just that, anything Philly has, DC has better."
,,Walkability
,,"1. Convenience - It has pretty much everything other big cities have but in a condensed area that's incredibly walkable and bikeable. 

2. There's plenty to do and it's often free. There's constantly events going on, on top of all the free sightseeing and museums all over the city. Cost of living is high, going out is expensive, but there's no lack of free or cheap entertainment. 

3. The people. When I'm swiping on dating apps, I like knowing there's a 90% chance everyone I'm looking at is well educated and liberal-minded, which are things I personally value."
,,"I haven't been in Philly for several years, but when I visited that city just depressed me. Everything felt like it was 20-30 years behind.

DC is expensive, but lots of job opportunities and modern conveniences. Virginia is a very well run state in particular compared to many with great schools.

What career are you in? Keep in mind that a more expensive city isn't necessarily bad if it results in a much higher salary or better opportunities for you."
,,"I currently live in DC, but I’m originally from the Philly area and I lived there for most of my life. Overall, I think DC is a nicer city. There are some really nice areas in Philly, but it has a lot more rough areas than DC. Another pro for DC is that public transportation is way better for DC and the surrounding areas. I also think there’s a better job market in the DMV area, but I guess that depends on what industry you’re in. The big pro for Philly though is that the COL is better. It might not make a huge difference if you’re renting, but it definitely will if you’re looking to buy a house. A nice house in the Philly suburbs would probably be like half the price of what it would be here."
,,"Positives about DC

* amazing food and restaurant scene
* diverse communities and people
* culture, museums, monuments
* Lots of great neighborhoods to choose from
* easy to navigate and get around
* multiple airports in the area for travel
* networking and job oportunities
* education (maybe not DC proper, but for most of the surrounding area). Plus many great higher ed institutions in case you want an advanced degree."
,,"Haven’t lived in Philly but actually just went there for the first time a few weeks ago after living in DC for 3 years. I loved it! 

DC is more transient; many of the people you meet won’t be from the area but it doesn’t mean they’re not invested in the community. The mixing of cultures makes DC really interesting and diverse if you’re into exploring those sorts of things.

DC is not as much of a “city” as Philly, which could be a pro or a con for you. I’m from the northeast and grew up outside of New York, so my idea of a city was everything New York is; hustle and bustle, tall buildings. DC feels like a “faux” city in comparison. The height limit on buildings makes everything feel more livable, but also much quieter. At first I didn’t like how certain neighborhoods or areas were so quiet on the weekends, but I’ve grown to like that living here for a few years. Philly on the other hand felt much more like New York than DC when I was there. 

A lot of the area around DC is/has been developed into suburban sprawl, some of it feeling soulless at worst, conventional at best. Much of it is nice, but nothing special. Its something that keeps me from wanting to be here long term, as I don’t think I could/would want to own in DC proper. That’s not to say places like Alexandria aren’t beautiful and charming. 

I don’t know if I can really offer much more as I don’t have too good of an understanding of specific Philly culture to compare it to. DC is a unique, fun, liveable city, with a lot of 20/30 somethings dictating many of the things around you. It’s expensive but there’s things that can’t be had in any other city like the museums and monuments and the people are generally wonderful.

I want to add regardless of where you choose, I hope you enjoy it and it works out for you!"

,,"I don’t know if it’s because people dress business casual more often or what, but there are many good looking people"
,,"Greenspace of DC is top quality. We have the more tree strewn neighborhoods in Mt pleasant and Woodley Park. In my mind though, the idea that we have basically a quarter of the city totally filled with a beautiful park that is under the jurisdiction of NPS is outstanding. Rock Creek park is the selling point of dc for me. Decent trails, beautiful running and biking on beach creek, picnic spots, and historical sites at Pierce Mill. Alongside the park is direct access to the zoo which is so pretty and a lovely day out. 

Others have discussed the bikeability and such. Which is also huge. I wish the buses ran on shorter intervals, but the buses are excellent here and seemingly there are plans to make them better.

It's tough because it really is expensive, but the access you here is better than Philly, with the added bonus of lots of free activities to enjoy, and an ever improving food scene. 

If I have one complaint (aside from cost) it's that DC doesn't have that obvious weird quality of say Philly or Austin. People here are smart, type A folks. There's a large LGBT populace, but it doesn't translate into a hip art scene and such. That's my opinion.

It's also very clean here compared to Philly or NYC."
,,Living in Philly is better but the job market and pay in DC is better. Comes down to what you’re looking for in a city. DC has extremely unwelcoming locals. It’s more spread out so it doesn’t feel like a metropolis. More museums in dc. More trails in the area than Philly. Worse drivers in DC. Crime seems to be the same although I think dc may have more shootings lately.
,,Get out and save your money!
,,"The better question is what you enjoy or would like to enjoy.  What makes other people happy is irrelevant unless you plan on enjoying specific activities with the person, try activities enjoyed by others, or attempt to improve the quality of life in one of the cities. I mean some enjoy horseback riding while others enjoy things like yoga, news, politics, gaming, having a family, swimming, wall climbing, watching plays or concerts, meetups, jogging, tennis, going to bars, watching comedies, bowling, watching movies, going to sporting events, having a pet, travelling to other places, etc."
,,"Love DC and have been here for 8 years, but in Philly you will have a better quality of life for less $$. I'd say Philly is a no-brainer. Both have great food, culture, diversity, history, art, cute neighborhoods, similar weather, but Philly is just cheaper.

One exception: Do you work in/ and are you passionate about politics/policy? If so, DC is the place where you will can create a network of friends doing important political work in different areas (government, nonprofits, consulting, etc.). If your advocacy work is really, really important to you--inside and outside of work--DC is obviously a much more political place. If you volunteer on campaigns on the weekend, are obsessed with fighting for climate/racial justice, etc., and know every member of Congress, then you will fit in in DC. If you're like a teacher or engineer or something and prefer not to talk about politics at all, DC is not for you."
,,"D.C. is really walkable in a unique European way.  Philly suffers a little bit in that it's broken up by odd pockets of bad sidewalks and is more spread out.

It will surprise you if you can manage to live inside the city core ,how clean ,walkable, bike able, and dense it is.  Rock Creek Park and the National Mall are both really great green spaces.   It's a 3x3 mile square that is continuous, well-managed urbanity and it has less hilliness than SF.  The suburban minicities here like Tysons Corner or Rockville have everything you can get in most medium-large American cities PLUS they are more diverse and educated if you're into that."
,,"neither.  Live in Baltimore.  Cost of living is way cheaper, and you are a 30-45 minute train ride from Union Station in DC."
,,"--City itself is relatively small (in area) which makes it easy to get between neighborhoods and in some ways makes it feel like a big town and less like a big city. 

--because of federal government and the many non-profit organizations based here, the city is full of interesting, smart people from around the country and the world

--lots of interesting events all over the city all the time (at least pre-covid)

--lots of people visit DC so for many people their friends and family want to come visit often. Relatedly many people come here to work or for school for a few years (or sometimes longer!), so you may have friends move nearby more often than if you lived in another, less transient city.

--Winters aren't as bad as bigger cities further north. In fact I think the only really negative thing about DC is how bad the summers get (although at least we don't get smoke and forest fires like out west)

--so much interesting history, beautiful parks and monuments, and free museums. Sometimes I lose interest in them because they are always around and I stop appreciating them but really there is always some place to go that is fun and interesting.

--I guess this fits under ""beautiful parks"" but it's worth its own bullet point: Rock Creek Park. I've really started appreciating it more during the pandemic. A lot of trails, nice biking or walking on Beach Drive, cool views from the bridges, just really relaxing spot. I don't know any other cities that have such a large park where you can honestly feel like you are miles away from the city (although if you know of any I'd love to hear about them)"
,,"If you live in or near DC proper, then having 3 major airports all < 1hr give or take gives you great options on pricing and destination."
,,"I hate to say this but, there’s no rational reason to move here unless you really *have* to, ie a career thing or you happen to just be a native. It’s a great place to visit, and that’s doable from Philly, but everything is less for more
here. Housing, parking, dining out, 60% of the metro trains are currently out of commission due to a detailing issue. There’s no quick way in or out; something as simple as a trip to the store can consume a whole afternoon. Making friends and relationships is exponentially difficult. I love the town, please don’t take his the wrong way, but there’s a reason people tend to not
stay very long. Now for the positive: Tons of stuff to do all the time, and much of
it free. Beautiful springs, mild winters. One of the most highly educated concentrations of people in the world which, can cause feelings
of inadequacy (for me, anyway), but would
aligns with what your values seem to be. Lastly, lots of great parks in and around the city, and while Virginia gets a negative stigmatization by DC residents for reasons I can’t figure out, it too has beautiful parks and vineyard country just an
hour or so away."

,,"Philly reminds me of a cross between Boston and Baltimore. DC has a more buttoned-up vibe.   


I'm from New England and have also lived in the midwest and west coast. I've been in DC for over 20 years and like it well enough. I've seen it change a TON. I'm not sure what the situation with development is in Philly, but there's been a lot of fancy new buildings going up and wealthier people moving in. Neighborhoods many people never heard of years ago are now booming--H street/Atlas District and Union Market are two key examples. Rent here is expensive but you can find some deals if you look closely, act quickly, and decide what trade-offs you're willing to deal with. I chose a building that is not terribly fancy so I could be close to the metro, for instance.   


We have great museums here and many of them are free. Good restaurants, lots of movie theatres, plenty of bars. If you're into sports, DC has tons of intramural leagues. You can survive without a car here. Rock Creek Park is great for nature strolls.   


I am not too familiar with the restaurant scene in Philly, but I agree their dim sum is way better. As others have noted, the better Chinese restaurants in the area are in the suburbs."

,,I'm currently interviewing for a job in DC and a job in Philly so hopefully in the next week or so I'll be in a somewhat similar situation. It's definitely a tough choice but the COL is definitely pulling me towards Philly if given the choice.
,,"Having been in both, and moving back to philly after 6 years here… DC is great for a short stint. Its not the kind of place you stay permanently imo. Generally I dont find people as friendly, relationships dont last as its very transient, and the traffic fucking sucks, so be ready to live somewhere along a metro or within a short commute. 

That said, its a great place still. It has great walkable areas, particularly if you live downtown. The food and drink scene is diverse and interesting. There is a ton of wealth here as well. Streets are much cleaner, a lot of free things to do too. 

The drive back to Philly isnt too bad either, gets old after a while with about $28 in tolls (Im from the NJ side of the river, so slightly less for you). 

With all thats happened with covid tho, Im opting out and heading to the Philly suburbs."

But one of the best things about living in Washington DC is that you can get around everywhere by Mattara but that’s the same in Philly. I feel as though in Washington DC there are a lot of events that are always happening and if you are into politics this is the place to be and rock Creek Park is one of the most beautiful places to enjoy the nature in Washington. DC is the fittest city in the nation too.

As you said, I think it depends on your priorities and interests. I loved living in DC and miss it now that I’m away.  I made Philly work, but never really liked it the same way. I have friends who are the exact opposite—but I value things like museums, safety, green space, diversity (people & food), educated population, etc more, and they value sports, longevity of relationships (bc people don’t move), consistency, one specific culture more. Neither one is better, just better fit for the person."
,,"> I feel like less of an outsider here because so few of the people I work with and have become friends with are from here.

I agree with what you said but want to point out that in reality, people from DC do exist, but exist almost entirely in different social circles from people who move here from elsewhere. I'm not talking just about class/racial divides, though they obviously exist and contribute to this. I feel this is worth pointing out because new arrivals (like OP) can easily get the impression that ""no one"" is from DC and that attitude can have a negative downstream impact. I don't think that's what you were trying to say, just wanted to clarify for OP."

If you make twice as much and your cost of living is twice as high, you're definitely better off, because that means your savings and fun money are *also* doubled. Even if you have to go from spending 20% on rent to 50% (meaning that your rent *more than quadrupled*), that would still be an improvement, since the remaining 50% of your new salary is more than 80% of your old one."

Philly's Chinatown gives you a similar vibe to NYC/Flushing/SF, just not on the same size and scale. The good Chinese restaurants in the DMV are in Rockville, and they're not really concentrated. In Philly you can get go to Chinatown, get dim sum, stop by a Chinese bakery, buy some vegetables, get some matcha ice cream, all within 1 city block if you wanted to. Can't do that in Rockville without a car, and the DC gallery place is really Chinatown in name only."

Things like shootings and rogue dirt bikes are prevalent in both. But I can list some Pro vs Cons for Philly.

Pros: Smaller feeling, more easily walkable, less of a transient culture (that obviously I am part of), better food scene (IMO, though DC's is fine), different neighborhoods have distinct charm so you can choose the one that works best for you, easier access to NYC/Northeast in general, better housing market.

Cons: The small one-way streets can get really annoying/claustrophobic, not as easy to access a wider variety of nature, depending on where you live you may have to rely on busses more than subway, trash situation is a bit wonky.

Again, they're both good, I like living in DC, but I just love Philly."

,,I didn’t arbitrarily decide anything. The OP asked about living specifically in DC (not DMV/NOVA area) compared to Philly. I was responding to the OP’s question.
,,"I mean Philly might be twice as big, but 710000 isn’t something I would consider small. Crime rate wise, both cities are almost identical (though I think DC‘s is a bit higher). This is the way I always compare the neighborhoods by their similarity when someone asks me: Ward 8 in DC is like the troubled parts of North Philly, Ward 7 is like SW Philly, Ward 6 is like the southern part of North Philly, Ward 5 is West Philly, Ward 4 is NE Philly, Ward 3 is NW Philly, Ward 2 is Center City and Ward 1 is South Philly. One of the major difference though is that except for black people in DC, everyone else seems to be a transplant, whilst in Philly they are real ass locals."

,,"What part of DC do you live in?  For being such a small city, DC has a lot of pockets and neighborhood differences can be stark.  For example, Takoma has much different vibes than Ad Mo, which has much different vibes then Downtown or even Mt Pleasant.  Maybe check out Eastern Market on a weekend day, not just the market but the surrounding areas too.  And figure out what you liked about London.  DC is no London, but neither is any other US city."
,,"If you've been getting ""the feels"" from Baltimore, maybe you would enjoy hanging out in the northeast part of the city more? I grew up in a non-Chicago Great Lakes city and besides just taking the occasional day trip to Baltimore, Brookland and the nearby neighborhoods definitely feel the most home/like my version of a ""real city"". Would add the Georgia Ave corridor through Maryland (Silver Spring/Wheaton, not like, Olney) as well"
,,"Your post makes me wonder to what degree our perceptions of cities are influenced by our state of mind before/while moving there. For example, SF was the first city I moved to after leaving my small hometown and I was in LOVE with everything about it, rose colored glasses effect. When I visit now, it doesn’t hit nearly the same way. 

Moving from London to DC is arguably a downgrade in a lot of ways (and I say this as someone who LOVES DC), and I wonder if this is subconsciously affecting your feelings about it? 

After living in so many cities I feel like they are Rorschach tests that reflect aspects of ourselves back at us. 

Or, maybe it’s just not a match?"
,,"I wonder if the sentiment of DC feeling soulless or missing the “it factor” despite the abundance of cultural institutions, diversity, landscapes etc., is that it’s a relatively small city with a huge amount of tourism. So much of the culture feels like it’s not “for us”."
,,"i think we invest too much in the cities we live in, personally. like why do so many people make the city they live in core to their identity? i say that as someone who LOVED dc and lived there for a decade (I just left), and it was definitely a big part of my identity.

to a certain degree though a city is what you make of it. your network, your routines, your home, etc. DC is pretty livable insofar as it’s very walkable, easy enough to get around, lots to do, etc. so it is what you make of it! if you have a job you love and a network of social connections, you can really love anywhere.

EDIT: my point is really: invest in those things (social connections, your home, routines that bring you joy) and you’re likely to love it here or anywhere else!"
,,"Move back to Baltimore or move to Philly. It's cool, not everybody likes every place."
,,"It took me a good year or so to really love DC. Part of the problem was that the first place I lived was this mega apartment complex in Falls Church, so even though I was spending 10+ hours a day in DC, I wasn't really able to fully immerse myself in it. Moved to Dupont then later Petworth and everything changed. Plus lots of people I know who moved to new cities during the pandemic had a harder time getting to know them.

Also, you say that it feels flat and like a Hollywood city set. Have you ever read up on the history of DC, not the political aspects but the communities and people and outside-of-Capitol-Hill stuff? There's SUCH a rich culture. When we were new there, my husband and I used to pick a new random neighborhood to read up on and explore each weekend. We had this book that would point out culturally significant spots. Made me appreciate DC as a city apart from the nation's capital. 

I'm in a new city now that I love, but man, nothing will ever replace that energy that DC gave me. Of course, it could just be that it's not for you, which is totally ok! Philly and Baltimore are also great!"
,,"You're living in a city that still hasn't bounced back to anywhere close to where it was before the pandemic. That's going to be true in every major city right now, it takes years for the cultural heart of a city to recover"
,,"Sounds like a depression problem, not a city problem. Went through that in Boston during college myself. I wish I had done therapy then. (It wouldn't have prevented me from coming home after college because I work in a very niche part of my field, but I would have struggled less in college.)"
,,"Large parts of DC are populated largely by young people who bring money into the city, but won't be staying for long. That leads to a kind of shallowness imo. The establishments that tend to be most profitable in these areas don't have much of a neighborhood feel, because most of the people they cater to aren't going to be around for long.

There are good spots though. Mt. Pleasant is a favorite neighborhood of mine, my spirits lift every time I go there."
,,DC isn't London. However the last year and a 1/2 has not been representative of what dc can offer. I have left and come back twice now. Each time it took me a while to find a group of  friends .  Goes to show just how transient this city is.
,,"I’ve lived in London, DC, and Philly, among other places, and I see what you mean. I still visit Baltimore and go back to Philly regularly because they have a closer feel citywide to what you’re describing."
,,"So I just went through almost the exact situation as you described, but my move was from another state to DC. All I can say is that you need to separate the city from yourself. 

All this means is that you have probably been through a lot. A change in scenery is nice, but won’t bring you the happiness your looking for. We have to work on ourselves and by doing that you’ll likely start enjoying the city for what it is. 

I always compare it to the happiest moments in life. Typically if I look back, most of those moments are a mix of the right people, place, and mindset."
,,"1000% relate, don’t think ill ever love a city as much as I loved london <\3"
,,"I think that's fine and understandable. I've lived in DC for 10+ years and love it here, I think it gets a bad rap, but not every place is for everyone and that's fine.

Have you found a group to join? I have a few social groups in the city and I have found that it has made it LOADS better. It's not work related at all and doesn't involve going to a bar.

Also, I think a lot of people don't realize there is a Washington and a DC and they are very different. Unfortunately a lot of stuff in DC is racialized, and no offense to anyone, but usually it's white people complaining there is no character to the city when there is plenty. It's just you have to look for it outside of your comfort zone. Have you been to a gogo concert or a festival?

I hope things work out for you, it's tough to be in the position you are in."
,,"I understand what you mean. I’m a transplant too and it doesn’t really have that city charm (in my opinion) that I get from SF, NY, or London. DC is really clean and nice but for me, it just seems like it lacks culture."
,,"I’ve been here for over a decade, have had similar thoughts to you, kept thinking it would get better, but it doesn’t. Cut and run."
,,"It took me a few years (yep had depression during them, still do) to love DC. Still not sure I’m *there* yet, but it has grown on me since moving. Keep trying, keep finding charms - museums, events (we get most of the big artists and musicals!), speakeasies, and that friends and family will love to visit the Capital - there’s a lot to like and develop love for over time. You’ve got this!"
,,"I’ve found living in DC to be meh.

There is some decent food, some fun things to do, and the city infrastructure is just a chaotic mess with no hope of ever actually fixing it given the current government architecture. MAYBE if DC became a state the latter could be fixed.

There are a few people I’ve met who LOVE DC but can never actually explain why beyond “it’s just the vibes” Those people have also never lived in a bigger city. Near a bigger city sure, but “I lived in the suburbs of Boston” is different than being in Boston, just like living in Annandale is different than DC.

I think the general vibe of people who love it are from people recently out of college who are spending their first time in a “big” city and exploring who they are. They figure it out, then they leave to do whatever they are actually doing with their lives. The people who stay are then usually in the government complex and that leads to a very homogeneous culture because it takes a certain mindset to last there.

I’m doing my best to enjoy it while I’m here, pay way too much for way too little compared to a city like Chicago, and will eventually be able to leave and go enjoy living in a city better supportive of my interests and without the sway of the government.

Also the fact Ted Cruz has anything to do with governing my life when I can’t vote for my own representatives is total bullshit."
,,"Bit of the opposite for me so I guess it just comes down to individual preferences in the end. Used to be here but moved to London (back in DC for Christmas). London is great but I just can’t love it, and walking around DC last night just felt so comfortable and nice to me. The only thing I miss about London is the transit system."
,,"I think the answer is clearly more soulless Navy Yard-esque cookie cutter condos that look exactly the same from Omaha, Nebraska to Raleigh, North Carolina to Boise, Idaho."
,,"I break a lot of my life down to “set and setting”, i.e. my frame of mind and the environment that I am in. 

You sound lonely. I get it. I could feel lonely too but I choose to look at is as freedom. Free do do what I want, all of the time. 

Pick a person in your head that appeals to you. Celebrity, the person next door, anyone that is positive. Now imagine a day out in the city with said person, doing things that bring you joy. 

Georgetown, a walk on the mall, a museum, dancing on the upper level at Wonderland Ballroom hoping that the bowing floor doesn’t collapse…

Did you smile? There’s a start. Now just keep going with it. 

Seasonal depression is a thing. My side gig is driving a few hours a month for Uber and Lyft. I get all walks of life in and out of my car. It usually gives me a pretty good pulse on the city. I don’t do it for the money. It’s my form of social interaction should someone wish to talk to me. I consider it meeting cool people, 15 minutes at a time. My only goal is for them to be in a better mood when they get out of my car, than when they got in. 

With that said, I will leave you with this virtual gift. 

This is a very special gift 
That you can never see. 
The reason that it's so special 
It's just for you from me. 
Whenever you are lonely or even feeling blue, you only have to hold this gift and know I think of you. 
You never can unwrap it, please leave the ribbon tied. 
Just hold this gift close to your heart, It's filled with love inside.

Wishing you all the best. Starting now :)"
,,"DC has a very move for work career focused vibe or a don’t yuppie my neighborhood vibe with sometimes little in between. If you loved London, you might fit better in Brooklyn or other parts of NYC. It’s very likely your job has a New York office."
,,"Could be a bunch of things here. Maybe you need to spend some time learning about the history of the area. Lots of neighborhoods have rich and layered histories and I find that learning them makes me feel like I’m part of that narrative today. 

Regarding your idea that DC is kinda fake and like a movie set - yes. That was my thesis in architecture school, and it’s something every city does to an extent but especially capital cities. Lots to learn and look at, but I think if you see through the history of it and understand it (even critique it) rather than take it at face value, there’s a lot to love about this city even though it’s far from perfect. It has an identity though it can be hard to tease out between the politics, focus on transplants, etc that dominates the way we talk about it"
,,"Hi! I moved here after living in London for 7 years. Similarly I loved London and adjusting to being back in the US and DC was rough. 

I guess… I just sort of found things about DC that made me happy. The thing that drove me out of London was just how hard it was to live there, and I appreciate being able to afford more here in DC. 

One bit of advice is to actively pursue your interests here. I took up story telling with some classes at Story District, for example, and sort of felt like I was meeting people and doing something cool."
,,"I completely understand what you're saying -- lived in similar places and experienced a similar feelings. My suggestion is to move to another place that gives you the feels and keep working on your mental health and wellbeing. You don't need to stay in DC just because it sounds good on paper, objectively has the features you like"
,,"If you still feel like Bmore, Philly, and the outskirts of SF feel more city than DC…idk what to say. But I do know a few people who have moved back here after living in London and Amsterdam and compared to those, it’s the actual DC streets (well really just American streets but DC streets are relatively broad) that make it feel less “lived in.”"
,,"I know what your saying, when I went to philly to visit my friend, it felt more like a real city than DC or Baltimore. I think it has something to do with where people grow up and how people think the grass is greener on the other side. Depending on where we live it all comes down to making the most of any opportunity. DC definitely has an international presence and vibe to it but I get what you mean about how phony and flat things feel at times. Depending on which part of dc your in at times it feels too pretentious and manufactured similar to how I feel about Nova. This city could definitely use more culture and have less people living in the same thought bubbles."
,,"I think a lot of people who move to certain cities slowly dilute the culture and change the city to soulless landscapes (San Francisco). People move places, change them to their liking, and become upset that the place isn't cool anymore. Obviously, an individual can't do that, but gentrification is like a bacteria. U need some, and the right amount. Get too much or the wrong kind, and everything goes to crap."
,,You are not going to like every place and that's ok.
,,Hanging with the non-politics people and in the more non-political areas of the city makes a big difference. A lot more real local culture and less of that ‘fake feeling’. Not sure where you live but try to get away from Navy Yard/ Wharf/ MVT/ Downtown and look at other neighborhoods
,,"Fwiw I’ve lived in a lot of places (LA, NY, a few major cities in Europe, Latin America, India, etc.) and this is probably my least favorite city for the exact reason(s) you mention. 

I love Rock Creek Park, the neighborhoods are pretty, it’s bikeable, etc. But it just feels shallow and or presentational. I also feel it’s an uptight city, meaning people are more likely to get upset over trivial things that don’t impact them (which makes the city unusually tense). 

Whenever I’m back in NY or London, etc it wakes me up and I’m so much more engaged with the city. I honestly think it’s the people even though we have a good community of friends here… I often use the word “flavorless” to define the place. It’s well-plated, just not a lot of flavor."
,,I absolutely agree. Have lived here for years and I love the people and the beautiful rowhomes and walkability but dc does not feel like a real city. it lacks any and all chaotic energy. The National mall is sterile and boring. Some people love how clean and orderly it is here. Feels soulless to me
,,"You are correct, DC is emotionally flat, vanilla, bland, lacking a soul. Truth is, no one lives here anymore.  That’s the issue. It’s full if commuters, never leaving their mark. 

I recommend exploring other cities, even the ones you mentioned before committing to going back overseas. Also, yes to therapy! I am currently living in Baltimore (hate it), but spent all of my adulthood so far in Philly - I miss it terribly."
,,"I think people are probably right that it may be mostly a therapy problem… but DC is kind of flat city generally.. lots of type a ambitious weirdo people, very transient (20-30 year olds doing their time then moving where they actually want to), very touristy, weird racial dynamics (but hey that’s most cities in the USA)… say this as a 12-year resident that’s fairly happy here."
,,Never related to anything more in my life.
,,The only place that gives me the “feels” you describe is old town Alexandria. DC feels very sterile
,,"I’d describe dc as being aesthetically and socially very refined. In my opinion the people who tend to be attracted to DC are fairly ‘flat’ as you say. They’re living their life the way you’re supposed to,  they make good decisions, they went to the right school, they have a good job, but they aren’t particularly unique. The sort of people who mostly adhere to the status quo. I would call them boring/sterile, safe, mild mannered. DC, I think, is a great place to live if you want to live in a city that doesn’t have the chaos, unpredictability, and variability of most big cities. And it begins to feel small very quickly. Or just if you like living in cities but wanna take a breather for a few years. 

But not everyone sees it this way. Although to some extent, in my opinion, the people who respond to this characterization with ‘idk what you’re talking about that’s not my experience at all,’ tend to be, but are not always, the norm I’m talking about. I know this is a fairly negative characterization, but few places are objectively good or bad. This is just the other side of the coin to those who speak positively about it; sorta just a different view of the same things many like about dc."
,,Your first mistake was thinking DC would be anything remotely similar to London
,,"OP It’s the gentrification baby 🥹. DC truly lost its soul when they started to ONLY focus on those making hella money. When I moved to DC from NY in 2011 I specifically remember how I felt a certain level of soul in DC that I didn’t even feel in NYC. 

But then the luxury buildings starting replacing every empty space in the city when govnt should have just focused on keeping DC livable for ALL folks….because this is what truly makes a city. 

It’s a damn shame."
,,"You know what they say,  you cant run away from your problems.

Moving again isnt going to help,  start working out,  go talk to a therapist if thats your thing,  take a social media break.  

Something is keeping you in a fog and its not Foggy Bottom."
,,"Idk, I’ve spent time in London and would say it’s one of my least favorite cities. I don’t like giant cosmopolitan cities like NYC or Milan, London weather depressed me, and few things felt genuine. 

People just find their people and their vibes and excitement in different things, and I think it’s fine if this place doesn’t suit your preferences, start looking at options to move to Baltimore or Philly or maybe NYC."
,,"Few places in the world are London. The only place that really competes in the US is NYC. As you mentioned Baltimore, SF, Chicago, LA, and to a lesser extent, Boston will have a decent portion of it. 

But DC is an oddity. The population is largely transitory with fewer people having been here a long time. Those that have been in the area for a long time are often from outside in the suburbs. A lot of the attractions are really built for and focused on tourists. From museums, to restaurants, to food carts, they target people that will come into town once and never come back. Museums, theaters, and higher end restaurants will work for good reviews and rely on reputation to get people in the door while cheaper restaurants and food trucks can make money just by being there and overcharging tourists that will be upset but never come back again.

That said with any city… living in it isn’t about the city, it’s about the community. If you’re not 100% settled try different neighborhoods to see if you find a better community. Also find what you are interested in. I’m still very much missing my little neighborhood in NYC, but the area I find the most comfort from in the DC area is the music scene so there are a lot of shows i go to.

But if you don’t find what you want in the DC area, it’s easy enough to commute to from Baltimore, many people do."
,,"I never vibed with DC.


It definitely has great features but something was lost on me too.

It started really bothering when I traveled anywhere else I felt alive like I was breathing pure oxygen.  I’ve lived several places and enjoyed travel but never like that.

I don’t want to shit on DC because there are so many great things about it and it’s full of interesting people.  It was like being married to a model that I couldn’t talk myself into being in love with."
,,"I know I’m late, but this resonated with me and thought I’d chime in. I lived in DC for a few years, fell in love with it, planned to move to London (life dream), but then COVID hit, and now I’m elsewhere. Very much struggling with depression about not being where I want to be.

Definitely a good topic for counseling. Also, others may be right about DC not being a fit for you. Might I throw in another hypothesis — life stage. You loved London and other cities you’ve lived in up until now. Could this be the product of a different life stage making us (I’m also 30) feel differently about places? I wonder if we’ll ever be able to feel the same about a place as we did in our 20s?"
,,"' I can feel the 'soul' of the city '

I think DC has lost a lot of its soul. It's more expensive, more transient. 

More important though are the people you get to know. Make some friends and then see how you feel."
,,You're not alone. I've been in DC for 10 years off and on. First visited as a middle schooler in 1996.  It's a love hate relationship for me.
,,God DAMN some of yall need to pack up and move if you just constantly hate living here
,,"Wonder if you’re just… still a little depressed? 

Loving a city is about loving the people and things you do there as much as the place. You had a seemingly great life and a relationship, maybe you were doing things that made you happy you could see a long-term future there. 

A change of place was probably important but I’d start by focusing on finding people and activities that make you happy?"
,,"DC cultivates a very transactional culture as well. I find that sometimes people just talk to me as a stepping stone to what they really want. i’ve found valuable connections are really hard in DC, especially for younger people who may not have their emotions and wants fully figured out. i’ve never been “demanded” to do things or be a certain way anywhere else….just in DC. it feels like a chess game every time i go on a date. i don’t trust DC dating on the dating apps because of this. obviously this isn’t the same experience for everyone but as a young adult woman studying and working in the political science fields, everything EVERYDAY feels transactional. even the sex.

EDIT: very important to note that i’m talking about people who moved to DC, not the native DC population. DC people that grew up in the city are some of the coolest people on earth"
,,Sounds like you should talk to a therapist.
,,Do you have friends/community here? That makes the difference.
,,Because London is better.
,,"I’ve lived here for 7 years and had my ups and downs with mental health. I’ve found my happiness here but can say that this city lacks “character”. Compared to Philly, Richmond or Baltimore, there is very little room for fringe interests here."
,,"Have you found enough community spots to give it that feel? The Smithsonian, Georgetown, hiking, etc., are lovely but won't give you that feel you're looking for. I feel like you have to do a bit more work to make DC feel ""neighborhoody"" than you would have in Baltimore or London. I also love London and Baltimore, and I understand what you're saying. I do love DC but I had to really get to know it first before I had that feeling of  (it helps that I'm also from the DMV but only moved to DC proper after college). My issue is that all my friends left DC so I'm having to start from scratch at 29 years old for a local friend group 🙃."
,,"I dunno, if it makes you unhappy you don’t have to have a reason. I personally hate San Francisco but every person I tell this to is *shocked*. But I like DC—it has lots of diversity, places to go, interesting people, I don’t mind the weather (I’m from the Great Lakes region)."
,,"I have had the exact same experience living in this city. It’s such a sterile place it feels completely soulless to me as well. Having lived in other large cities, DC is undoubtedly my least favorite. For me the main thing missing here is real culture (of course there are amazing museums that I do genuinely love here but that is manufactured and curated culture). You go out in other cities & they feel alive. The young people (and everyone for that matter) are painting and drawing and designing and dressing weirdly and just genuinely doing really cool & interesting stuff. It feels like there is not any artistic scene here at all (Ik there are artists here ofc but nothing feels unique at all) & for me that just makes the whole place seem flat & boring."
,,"It's probably because despite all of the cool restaurants and shopping and such, the gentrification sucked all the culture that wasn't foodie, tourist or aloof yuppie"
,,Americans who lived short term abroad complaining that DC isn’t Europe are the worst
,,"It's a fake place. Too many people pretend they care and they just don't. That's not to say there are good people here - there are. But when I moved here and I asked someone how they liked the neighborhood, and the reply was ""sorry I don't have any money"", that sticks to you. And I don't think it's the people's fault completely either. I think it's a systemic failure of city policy and departmental arrogance towards things like homelessness and unemployment."
,,"A lot of DCs neighborhood centers lack some desirable traits that I think a lot of other big cities have more of - narrow streets with limited traffic, mature trees, views (DC is flat/no skyline/limited waterfront). The industries here are also not creative and I think that impacts everything - food, fashion, behavior.

,,"I've been here about a year and a half as well, and I also struggle. Granted I came here for law school, which doesn't give me much personal time to explore. Lived in Chicago, Paris (France), San Diego, Asheville (NC) and now here. It's ten times better here than North Carolina for me, but this city still doesn't feel like home. Everything is outrageously priced, the humidity and mosquitoes are unbearable, there is so much crime, drivers acting like they want to murder you, and people are friendly yet also distant. 

I'm of the belief that people are what makes a place a home, and I've struggled to find a community here. I also loved all the neighborhood eateries on the west coast where I could get a fantastic, complex or comforting meal for cheap and I just haven't found those here. We'll see what happens when I graduate. But I've had so many people tell me that deep friendships are hard to form here (and it just gets harder as I get older), and dating is a nightmare. I also don't want to uproot yet again having done 2 cross country moves in the last 4 years, but also missing the thrills."

,,Because DC sucks ass
,,Part of that is the cyclical nature of the city. A bunch of people are here only during the week. Congress is out for months at a time.
,,I have similar feelings that you’re describing and I think that what other people have said about community is a big part. A lot of DC is hyper transient so there aren’t a ton of neighborhoods where people spend large portions of their life. Think that makes it feel less loved. I think Admo and Shaw neighborhoods might have more of what you’re looking for

,,"I've been here for 3 months and I sorta agree with you, and [commented elsewhere here on DC culture.](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/zz8i1d/trying_to_understand_why_im_struggling_to_love_dc/j2ayrq1/)

When I reflect on why I moved here it's always a focus on *career career career*, and I'm positive I'm not alone in that. Everyone seems like they bring baggage (some good, some bad) from other places if that makes sense, and there's an understandable emphasis on uglier realities of life like politics, power, and the military industrial complex. I've met a lot of selfish people who see themselves as the main character in the story of their big DC career, which part of me understands.

But there are almost limitless opportunities to find groups to connect with outside all the ugliness. I'm a hypocrite because I critique all these things but don't put in the work to be outgoing and find something new. I'm aiming to change that in 2023. I hope you find whatever you're looking for too."
,,"To be completely honest, after living here for almost a decade I am still of the conclusion that DC just isn't that great a place for most people. I'm yet to meet someone IRL who sincerely loves the city in the same way that people love New York or London or Tokyo or Paris or wherever (though I'm sure people will try to convince you on this sub).

That's okay though, it's still possible to have a great life somewhere that isn't that great. And there are plenty of great things about the city, which is a really livable place even if as a whole it doesn't have that magic some other places have."
,,"I live here too. DC does not compare to London.  It’s still a great city, but no comparison."
,,"I’m wondering if it isn’t the lack of a personal connection. The DC community tends to be transient for a lot of professions and that makes it hard to develop a community’s sense of self. If you lack a romantic connection (which you appear to have had in London) that could also be factoring in. My last shot at an answer is similarly ~~woo~~ but you never have a love like your first, and it might just be that nothing will replace London for you."
,,"Sometimes DC feels like a company town which can feel oppressive. I can't say I love DC or as you say, that it gives me the feels. However, what makes me want to live in DC is my family and friends. DC buildings, parks and monuments are beautiful but nothing beats being near those I love."
,,"I agree that there is a general sense that a huge chunk of the population is less stable because many people come for short term work, school, political campaigns, internships etc. another chunk come to start their career but leave at a certain point for more affordable locations because they are effectively priced out of decent-sized permanent housing (like for starting a family).

It got to a point with me where I wondered if making new friends would even be worth it because they’d move and I personally struggle to maintain long distance friendships. 

Local people with roots typically aren’t interested in making new friends- they have their circle of people already.

Not a lot to say here other than I went through the same thing and the few friends I still have also settled in the area and bought housing here."
,,"OP, I’ve lived here 15 years now and it’s hands down one of the best cities in America. I have had many a good times in DC. It definitely has a culture and many cultures. It is such a rich town of experiences and cultures. But since the pandemic, it has been one of the most depressing, low states of the city I’ve ever seen. It is really sad. A bit slower and just somewhat empty. Parts of the city used to be jumping most nights and they’re just empty now. I do think your reason for being here, and the following disappointments with relationships make the situation worse. But it’s not all you. The city is in a post-pandemic low itself and it is slowly coming back to life. Also, people, themselves, are in a post-pandemic low and coming back to life. So give yourself some grace. Maybe give the city some grace, if you can. And know that change is constant. That means everything is constantly changing, so if the good times sometimes become bad ones, then the bad ones will also become good. There’s likely no magic wand or magic place to be in the world right now except for inside one’s self, where if we can set down judgement, self criticism, and self abandonment and pick up a radical self love and give that to ourselves. Because to keep it real, many of us are just struggling to feel loved, accepted and embraced. Give it to yourself first, little by little, whatever you can. Love is an inward then outward experience. Whatever is happening on the inside tends to reflect in the outer reality. So focus on loving yourself, being gentle and gracious with yourself as you heal. You deserve every good thing. You deserve patience and grace. You are worthy. Many blessings."
,,Stop thinking and start living.
,,I’m from DC. It’s stale and filled with transplants who sucked the soul dry.
,,"I have been living in DC for seven years and I still don’t love it (have lived in AdMo, Foxhall, and now Silver Spring).

Probably has everything to do with the fact that I moved from Vienna, Austria to here. Still think that most European cities are so much more liveable, affordable and safer than US cities. Also much better infrastructure (restaurants, culture, public transport etc) in similar sized cities. The one advantage DC has are definitely its residents, so many interesting people I have gotten to meet over the years!"
,,"Everyone has different preferences and there is nothing wrong with that. You don’t need an explanation or justification, you are allowed to simply like or not like a place. I’m a DC area native who has lived in 6 different states all across the country in adulthood. I also travel a lot. I currently live in the Bay Area and simply don’t like it here. That isn’t to say it’s awful and that there aren’t things I enjoy or appreciate here but at the end of the day it just isn’t my cup of tea. I don’t live in San Francisco but honestly it is my least favorite city of anywhere I have ever lived or traveled 🤷‍♀️. We all have preferences. I am fortunate to have this experience of living in different places but also am fortunate that I have the opportunity to move back to the DC area this summer, which I am looking forward to since I like it better. I wish you all the best in figuring out what is best for you and knowing that it’s okay to have your own preferences!"

,,Every US city except NYC or Chicago is going to feel like a fake baby city compared to REAL megacity like London lol.
,,You should prob move to one of those cities that gave you the feels
,,DC kinda blows that’s why
,,"IMHO, you're right. DC is, mostly, a soulless city. Most of the soul has been priced out of the city altogether, with the exception of institutions that are marginal and probably not long for this world (I think of places like Rhizome, Bridge St. Books, etc.) The ""soul"" of the city, any sense of vitality, is so disconnected from the city's transplants, money, and major industries that it's unlikely to be felt unless you've got deep roots here. There's nothing to defend or to be precious about in this city, so I don't blame you or ""depression."" It's OK to take it out on your surroundings."
,,As a transplant who moved here for a job 3.5 years ago I still struggle feeling “home” in DC. The pandemic didn’t help. DC is also atypical (which is unique but also can be weird) for the reasons other people including yourself have stated here. I’d just try to meet some people.
,,"As someone that grew up in DC I can understand. People in DC are transitional and mostly here for work, school and a  rare find someone that actually grew up here. To say why I love the city would sound like a David Attenborough documentary. DC isn’t London though sometimes there are places you can still get a good English breakfast and a pint of ale.  The national arboretum is great for long walks as well as the National Hot House  but it’s no Kew Gardens."
,,"I've lived close to DC my entire life, and agree.  I've been to Philly and NY city, and you instantly know where you are when you're there.  DC just lacks a certain cohesion to me."
,,"London is one of the best cities in the world. No other city comes close besides Singapore. 

American cities are a joke compared to London. 

Honestly, DC can be vibrant or soulless. What makes or breaks a city is the community that you belong to."
,,Have you tried psychedelics? they do a pretty good job with connecting people to themselves/their environment.
,,"I think its because DC is super transient.  People will downvote me for this, but it doesn't have much culture, and the culture it does have is shitty politics.   So I totally empathize with you.

There isn't anything that makes it feel like home.  In new york city, you've got bagels and pizza.  Washington DC isn't a place for anyone, it's an ""international"" city.  Anything you can find in DC you can find in any other city.  

That being said if you like the capital and the mall its great.  I love the mall and the capital architecture almost as much as I love my america the beautiful parks pass and american parks!!!"
,,"The city is great, DC is one of the best places to be on the East Coast. Maybe you need to do some soul searching thought and it’s fully understandable. The place might not be the right time."
,,"I agree. I’ve been here two years and it’s been disappointing. It’s definitely a weekend city, not much goes on during the week. Coming from Fed Hill it’s definitely a lot quieter overall."
,,"US cities are fucking trash compared to Europe. It’s not even close. The public transport is dick. The road infrastructure is dick. The people are dick. The cost of living and standard of living are dick. It’s hard to get a good salary in Europe but if you make over 80k across the pond your life is better than someone making 300k in the US. No plazas, no parks, no communal energy. I will say I recently moved here and couldn’t agree more. I spent 5 years in Spain, Italy, and Greece.  I have also lived in Brooklyn. DC just has no energy. So many beautiful streets completely empty. And it seems like even when there are people everyone is on edge. I see white peoples in politics or homeless people on the sidewalks, rarely anything else. I was told this was an international metropolis."
,,Could it have something to do with the violence? I was mugged in broad daylight at my front door a couple of months back. I will be very grateful to move out of here. And I’ve been a DC resident for most of the past 50 years.
,,NYC is much closer to London then DC is. DC is a city for people who don't like cities
,,I completely understand your experience. Moved here from Philly a year ago and am already planning to move back. I knew I loved Philly but was excited to find things about a new city to love. But there is no soul or personality here. I feel alive again when I’m back in Philly.
,,"I recently moved to DC. I have lived many places in my life, internationally as well as different parts of the US. 

DC has been my least favorite by far. In fact i despise it here. I personally feel DC and the surrounding area is complete void of culture. There is absolutely nothing to do besides eat/drink. 

The “hiking” is terrible compared to other areas of the world, and you are hours from the coast. 

Worst part of it all… its a high cost of living area… I am here for work and thats it… like every other soulless individual that lives here."

If you *don't* need to be here, I recommend finding somewhere else to live."
,,"It's too much of a transient work city outside of the African-American DC population who have been here for generations (and they're being pushed out by gentrification). It doesn't allow for a sustained, vibrant culture."

,,"Nope. I absolutely love it here. One of the great Capitols of the world. Totally understand how it must be difficult to transition from London, another one of the world’s greats. Embrace the history.  Not thousands of year’s worth like London, but the span of our Nation’s existence."

,,I feel this EXACT way
,,[deleted]
,,"I agree with this. I had lived in Cleveland Park, Capitol Hill and Glover Park for 5 years, finally moved central city in August (Shaw/Logan Circle) and it really has shifted my experience in the city. I have feels for the first time. Areas like Mount Pleasant / Bloomingdale are also absolutely lovely and give completely different but new city sensations too."
,,"Agreed. Current resident of the Brookland area and from Midwest, love the vibe of this neighborhood."
,,Same here.  I grew up in Milwaukee and DC didn’t feel like home until we moved to NE.
,,I'll check it out! I haven't been up there yet. Just googled it and the pictures look great.
,,">After living in so many cities I feel like they are like Rorschach tests that reflect aspects of ourselves back at us. 

I think you eloquently summarized the complex relationship between cities and human beings. State of mind is so important."
,,Perhaps I’m biased but the Obama years were a vibe. Had a lot of fun in the city during that time. Post pandemic I barely recognize some places.
,,"I think the real reason is that so many people move here for work and work only. There are few people actually from here. Even the people ""from here"" are often the children of civil servants or government contractors who moved here decades ago for the same reasons. You don't get a lot of multi-generational families who have been here for decades outside of the African American community. DC is dead during the holidays; clearly home is elsewhere for the vast majority of transplants. There's little sense of civic pride. It's a company town at its heart. Quality of life is high, but besides government shop talk, there's little keeping residents feeling connected with one another and the city in general.

I know I'm only here still because of my job."
,,"It is easy to get away and stay away from the tourist zones. Most of them are concentrated on the Mall/Wharf which is easy to avoid. Many locals (not one of them) avoid the Mall, for example, like the plague. Having grown up in a touristy city (Philly) I guess I learned early how to avoid tourists when they get annoying. Besides DC like Philly tourists are only interested in areas that locals can avoid if they want (Mall=Independence Hall area for example)"
,,"I feel this. Personally for me, I’m a huge sports fan, and while the city has some great teams with good facilities that are easily accessible, I have a hard time identifying with something that’s so important to me. I’ve adopted some of the teams and have soft spots for others, but I’m just not as passionate about wanting to go out and experience that in one way or another, whether it’s watching at a bar, or going to games, like I would in other cities. It’s not a flaw in the city, but just a barrier that’s keeping me from connecting with the city as much as I want to.

I’ve also lived in transient areas of the city and metro area, and just don’t feel a deep connection to these neighborhoods. Sure, I could move somewhere that has a better sense of community, but speaking for myself, it might feel better than it does now but nothing would be able to replicate the connection I feel to the community I’m from originally. 

That’s all to say, I think the city is vast with culture, even a perceived lack of culture because there are so many transplants and government employees gives the city a bit of a unique identity comparatively. I do think it’s just very different for each individual; what’s for some isn’t always for others and that can affect how connected people feel. That’s all on top of a chunk of the culture catering to tourism."
,,">So much of the culture feels like it’s not “for us”. 

Culture is meant to be ubiquitous in a town, not some menagerie of different boxes you're supposed to acknowledge like you're wandering a museum.

I'm not dissing diversity or promoting ethnocentrism or anything like that. But throwing a thousand different cultures into one city doesn't necessarily create this beautiful rainbow; it can create a gray mess that lacks identity."
,,I completely agree.
,,It’s some of that but also that there are so many transplants and foreign workers in the area not to mention the fact we have a lot of foreign and domestic tourists as you say that it all combined kinda dulls out the city culture that you can see. It also doesn’t help that during holidays and the heights of tourist season a lot of residents tend to either leave town or stay home to avoid those from out of town.

All those years that people clamored for gentrification. Well, be careful what you wish for or you might just get it. Crime is still an issue in DC although it's still MuCH less than the way it was when I was growing up.

I usually have plans every weekend and am trying to build a 'tribe', but yeah somehow the idea of being totally alone in London feels more appealing than being with friends here sometimes. I could go back, it would just mean admitting that I made a mistake coming back to the US and that I wasted the last year and a half of my life, when I could have been with my friends there building a future. A year and a half really isn't that long in the grand scheme of things I guess, but I am also tired of uprooting and wondering if I'm just chronically dissatisfied.

Edit: Also if I'd stayed, I would only be a year away from getting my citizenship in the UK now. If I go back I'll have to start over, which means another 5 years of waiting to become a citizen and worrying about losing my job and Visa.

,,"Agree 100%. I've been in the area for nearly a decade and recently moved back to Europe (not London) and even in a smaller EU city, the difference is notable. Besides the obvious differences (better transit, far more walkable) there's just more culture and above all, a sense of community and cohesion here. There's festivals and things to do year-round, people aren't so damn hostile and on edge the entire time, etc.

In DC I couldn't even afford to stay in the city, I finally ended up out in Fairfax County which is even more depressing. Nothing but cookie cutter townhome developments and shitty chain restaurants. Just look at /r/nova if you want to see what daily life is like out there - every post is either traffic-jam memes or about guns. Sums up this area pretty well.

Unfortunately I'm only overseas temporarily and will likely get dragged back to DC in another couple of years. My job is one of those DC-dependent careers difficult to replicate outside of the area so moving to another US city isn't likely in the near future. Not looking forward to it."

,,"The fashion is also...noticeably less impressive. Not a day went by when I was in England that I didn't see someone who took my breath away with their look and polish, and I know London is known for being the least 'attractive' of the European cities fashion and looks wise. People in DC don't seem to dress any differently than they do in the suburbs. I feel embarrassed dressing up here as if I'm being uppity for it. The parks are depressing, Malcom X park has beautiful 'bones' and potential, but the grass is always poorly looked after and half dead. This city seems to take no pride in its parks at all. San Francisco, Philly, and New York by contrast all had lovely green spaces."

DC culture really can’t be isolated to just the boundaries of DC because of that, unless you’re talking about the African American community like you said which has largely retained their family/community in one general area. So the “culture” of DC as a whole city gets spread so thin that it can feel different than other places. 

I still love it so much because of the history, the way this *is* the actual place government is (and the protests that we shove in their faces as a result), and this is where my family is but I can totally understand moving here with no roots and feeling kinda empty and not liking it much."
,,"Do you work in the ""company""? I see this sentiment constantly online but it's definitely not been true to what I experience, but I also don't work for the government or in politics or in a politics adjacent job. The only real difference from cities I've lived before is less focus on church as the primary community builder."
,,"I’m from DC and I roll my eyes every time someone says this. If you live in one of those giant new apartment buildings and only hang out at with other white people at places like Penn Social, yeah, it feels like no one is from here. 

If you live in a neighborhood and talk to your neighbors and people outside of your bubble, you will find lots of locals. When I lived in Mt. Pleasant, Shaw and Columbia Heights, most of my neighbors were from DC. In Dupont, most were rich out-of-towners. At my predominantly white office, I’m one of only two people from DC."

,,It also can't be easy trying to compare a more vibrant scene in \*any\* city pre-pandemic to the more muted scene that followed.
,,"Definitely worth bringing up with your therapist.

You may be out of that depressive episode, but it sounds like its effects are still lingering in some places. I found a meme that says, ""I'm fine, but it's a fragile sort of fine. If something happens, I'll break,"" and someone replied calling it ""eggshell fine."" That describes a lot of us right now. When I shared that with my psychiatrist, he upped the dosage on my secondary antidepressant, and I feel a LOT better."
,,Or maybe you just don’t like DC. I stay in the area for work but I don’t like DC compared with other cities. People will vehemently try to argue with you. Give it time but how you feel is how you feel.
,,"I’m not saying the OC is wrong but adding that not everyone likes every city regardless of mental health conditions. At my most depressed I still managed to love the city I lived in. I’m in a much happier place now, but I don’t personally like DC very much. At one point, I dreamed of living in DC some day and thought it was going to be everything I wanted but it didn’t live up to my expectations. I don’t hold that against DC or regret moving here, but I do look forward to change.

eta what I forgot: I have similar feelings to you… I sometimes feel like DC isn’t an authentic city. I love my friends here and uprooting sounds miserable but I dread living here long-term even more. Ultimately when my lease came up for renewal and I was looking at only being able to afford the 15 to 18 month options, I knew that my decision would be to leave."
,,"DC is more segregated by income level than many other cities, certainly Baltimore, Philly, NYC, and probably even London (from what I remember the last time I was there 20 years ago). For example, you’ll never be in a bar in DC having a random conversation with a construction worker on one side of you and a bond broker on the other side (which happened the last time I was in Manhattan). The economic classes don’t mix much here."
,,I'm not quite sure what the difference is but I felt so much more like myself during my visits to Baltimore and Philly compared to how I felt living in DC. Those places felt different to me and I felt more at home and emotionally like my 'normal' self -- I think I'm used to dirtier/grungier cities and that might be part of it
,,"Growing up in the DC area in the 80s, I can recall when Washingtonian would occasionally have cover articles comparing DC and Baltimore.  And it would always come down to something along the lines of ""Sure, we're better educated and make more money, but Baltimore has character and is ethnic and working class."""
,,"No, you're not the only one. I've felt this way always and preferred Bmore for feeling like a real city and for having character like ethnic neighborhoods, a working class, and an arts community. Someone once said to me that DC is too prissy and I think that summed it up for me."
,,"I will say, even in DC different neighbourhoods have very different feels. I’m much happier when I’m east of the river in Anacostia or in Northeast DC like around Brookland"
,,You are not alone😅
,,I blame the people who didn’t grow up in the dmv for why the cities vibe is off.
,,Down in the reeds is a very homegrown festival. Funk parade also. Art all night is a cool neighborhood based event.
,,"I was in an industry that was very hard to break into but had many opportunities here. I had a foothold here that would have been hard to establish again somewhere else and thought I’d move after a couple years in my first full time position. But it turns out I didn’t want to stay in that field and then needed my network/stability to make a switch. And poof - over a decade has gone by. I’ve made friends (over and over again as people move) and have community here, but I feel a sense of belonging elsewhere and want that again someday. I’m working on that now — wish me luck! 

And fwiw it’s not that DC is terrible, I certainly have had good times here, but I know that OP means when they say they never clicked in spite of working hard to."
,,"That’s a long story but you can’t only point to the US, everyone does it especially when you build a city knowing it is going to be a Capitol. A key thing I looked at for example is the appropriation of classical architecture as a signifier of empire across western (and even some eastern) countries. The Greeks and Romans started it but so did the French, the Nazis, etc. it’s changed a lot over the centuries too and the meaning has evolved like a comet picking up space dust. 

In terms of DC’s history, there are historic trails around with markers that are great to read. There’s a series around federal triangle, another in Southwest, there may be others I don’t know. Other accessible things could include documentary series, the building museum, the Smithsonian castle, or even the architect of the Capitol /GSA’s website where they list things such as how Moses is in the pediment of the Supreme Court. In terms of reading, you can get into the weeds of architectural theory fast, but message me if you want my whole references list lol. Kevin Lynch “Image of the city” Kirk Savage “Monument Wars” James Scott “Seeing like a state” come to mind."
,,"The last thing I’ll add here is that the National mall, monuments, and federal buildings are not, nor should they be, the only face of the city. It’s identity is also made up of all of the ordinary buildings and people that have lived and worked in them that make up the rest of the 95% of the district so I’d encourage you to look at it that way too"
,,"For books: Dream City, Urban Odyssey, Chocolate City, Go-Go Live. Also check out (and get a library card) the MLK branch of the DC Public library. They have fantastic exhibits of local history, a special collection, and a ton of historical recordings from residents."
,,"You should check out the Carnegie Library where the Apple store is. Upstairs is a wonderful exhibition on DC history. 

DC is on of the most organic cities in the US. People have been uprooted from so many neighborhoods and that has created some big gaps. Believe or not, but there was a large Jewish neighborhood in SE at one time. And where Union Station is there was a Polish hood. 

The fact that DC doesn't have real self-government has hampered the culture dramatically. All laws in DC require the approval of the US Congress. And all prosecutions are done by the US Attorney appointed by the President. You get convicted and you go to a Federal Prison. It's just a strange place. Most folks aren't invested in city so the political situation sucks.

But I digress.. I think it would do you good to get our of Georgetown. That spot hasn't been a representation of DC since the 1970s."
,,"I.e. a bunch of rich white people gentrifying neighborhoods with “in this house” lawn signs, yet moving out of dc when their kids get to middle school because the schools aren’t white enough…"
,,My point exactly
,,"Where's ""here""? You live in Rockville."
,,"Well you live in Rockville, not DC. You can relax."
,,"I thought of some experiences that endeared me to DC:

* Sitting in the booth at Florida Avenue Grill where MLK planned the March on Washington
* Getting a daytime guided tour of Frederick Douglass‘ house and his neighborhood haunts in Anacostia
* Visiting Abraham Lincoln’s Cottage and Soldiers’ Home in Petworth
* Eating a meal at Saint’s Paradise, the cafeteria for a church in South Shaw.

Unrelated to these experiences, I recommend watching FX’s The Americans (streaming on Hulu). It’s based in DC during the Cold War and captures an aura of the city I find captivating."
,,The lack of small businesses is a huge thing. I was just in Philly and it was like night and day compared to here.
,,"It's interesting that you have a solid group of friends and a lot of social plans but still aren't liking the city. 

Do you hangout/do the same things when you go out? Have you explored different neighborhoods? Especially because I feel like there are enough pockets in DC that gives the same feel as Baltimore (H St, Brookland, Mt. Pleasant, Georgia Ave, etc). I'm curious as to what the issue is and if it is maybe just something about the city that turns you off.

Also, what did you do to find friends here at this age?"
,,Great to hear this. I'm about to move from SF to DC
,,"On some level I agree with you. Though I find often the “grass is greener” people only look at a few dimensions of how it’s so much better living somewhere else which retards their ability to make the best of it here.

I give Europeans the benefit of the doubt, because often times their cities are better in many dimensions, but then if you point out that they are making 2 - 5 times more working in DC…

For Americans that studied abroad one semester in Rome, it’s pretty tiresome to hear about how much cooler Europe is, as if one can just snap their fingers and immigrant somewhere that doesn’t really want them, where they don’t speak the language, and they don’t have any legal right to make (by American standards) poverty wages.

But yea, US cities have a lot wrong with them. On that point we can agree.

/endrant

Edit: and I don’t often hear Latin Americans, Africans, or Asians complain to the extent of Europeans. Nor do Americans, on the whole, lift those places up as some idealized Disneylands where life is great all the time. Perhaps for mostly obvious geo-political and socioeconomic reasons, with some notable exceptions (Japan and Korea, for instance, though neither are issue-free places for westerners to build a life.)"
,,"Omg no I was just thinking it is such a chill space and based on your name you would prob like it. I went for bingo and was a winner the other night!! 

The owners are very chill also. It feels like central perk almost and has improved the community imo on the hill exponentially."
,,Have you been to rock creek park? Kingman island? Teddy Roosevelt island? The aquatic park when the water Lillie’s are in bloom? I feel like DC has beautiful nature spaces for a big city.
,,"A lot of the parks (including Malcolm X) are run by the National Park Service, not the city. And they're just not a priority for NPS, unfortunately."
,,"Honestly, I think some people might say that they prefer DC that way. But yes, people don't really dress differently from the suburbs.  

Similar to how some people prefer a pretty UI vs a functional system, I think DC does prefer function over form. Not to say you can't have both, but both requires a lot of effort.  

> This city seems to take no pride in its parks at all. San Francisco, Philly, and New York by contrast all had lovely green spaces.

As stated, the National Park Service runs a lot of parks and has other priorities, and well, funding issues too.

my dad grew up in the city so i was raised on stories of 930 and fugazi and bitch set me up and the bullets (RIP). many people just think about the white house and monuments. i just wish more transplants took the time to learn about the place they live in."
,,"Everyone's different but as a transplant who came here 4 years ago, I've seen so many people come and go in my time here. I socially don't really feel stable here. A bunch of friends left recently and I find myself back on the streets trying to make new friends again. It sucks. I just chalk it up to the fact that most transplants come here for school or work and then move on. And the fact that a lot of people move on makes it less likely for people to stay.

The amenities found in DC can be easily found in most other cities. There's nothing particularly special because there's no local culture to keep people grounded and feel like they are part of a community here outside of work or whatever social circles they have managed to drum up on their own."
,,Yeah this shit is so tone deaf. This thread is full of people to dense to realize they are making a whole city generalization  based on who they chose to surround themselves with.
,,"I take that back. There are many people from here but most transplants never get to meet them or interact with them in a meaningful way. The local African American communities and other ethnic communities like it mostly keep themselves in the background, as your Uber driver, the Metro station manager, the cashier at your grocery store, etc."
,,30% of people being born here seems awfully low to me. You’re making a lot of assumptions about that persons intent without any evidence that the figure you cite is typical or high compared to other places.
,,Got em
,,Point taken. My point is that most transplants will never get to meaningfully interact with many people from this community. Most local African Americans do not come out to meetups or other events that generally cater to transplants.
,,"I do work for the government indirectly yes, in a quasi-governmental agency. It's government but not officially government yet it is government in substance. I did work for the federal government at one point."

,,"Yeah the fact that you see the things on paper that should give you the tingles and everything feels flat absolutely sounds like depression is playing a role. Idk what your therapist is like but it can be easy to see depression and anxiety as ""better"" if your starting point was really bad. But sometimes it can morph from severe to a more sustained blah.

BUT I also think the reason you ended up here could also be affecting things irrespective of the depression angle. Not just the fact that you were in the thick of it, but that you didn't end up here amid a romance or to begin an exciting new chapter or whatever exciting circumstances you might have had when moving to other cities that you've loved. Your move here came from a breakup and heartache and all that, which can certainly taint things. Many years ago I did my undergrad in a city that everyone loovvvvves and I think I'd have loved it too if I'd lived there later, and I appreciated things about it, but all my best friends were experiencing college together in our home state and I had a couple rough breakups and I ended up feeling like I hated it there, which in hindsight was definitely all because of those circumstances and nothing to do with the city. I also lived overseas for a couple years and I know how we can get a bit spoiled by always having enchanting places around us - enchanting for their beauty and history but also, sometimes, specifically because they're not ours and we haven't spent our lives also dealing with the very mundane less-enchanting things.

And so while it's definitely true that not every city will be loved by everyone, based on the other cities that you DO love it's hard for me to imagine that you wouldn't find some of those things in DC under other circumstances. I also think that this being on your mind, and now being preoccupied by questions of ""Why don't I love this city? I SHOULD love this city!"" can affect things too. To *always* be head-over-heels about every place we live would be an incredibly privileged position that most of us won't experience, but it's also an unrealistic expectation and can often be the result of essentially othering the city instead of really becoming a resident (not saying you have that exact expectation, but I think throughout my 20s I got caught in that sometimes and I get a bit of that feeling from your post). In reality we may have better luck getting (or getting back) to that enchantment if we let go of that a little and just get to know a place. Not dissimilar from dating, really - it's hard to get to any kind of healthy relationship or even know how you feel if you come out of a breakup and start dating someone with a mentality of ""ok I SHOULD love this person, why don't I love this person, is something wrong with him, is it me, why don't I love him"" etc. In some cases, yeah maybe he's not for you. In other cases, those thoughts will interfere so much that it'll be impossible to even recognize the ways they might be great for you.

Anyway yes talk to your therapist about it and I wish you the best figuring stuff out!"

,,"""I don't like DC"" is different than ""DC has nothing to offer"". The former is a reasonable opinion, the latter is nonsense."

It's an okay place for my career, but I'm a software developer and San Francisco was definitely the It place to be for that. Baltimore was my first city out of college, and an escape from living in the suburban south, so I was enamored for a while. The college friend that I had in DC who was supposed to be my 'touchstone' and was my main reason for being here also friend-dumped me a couple of months after I got here, due to her own issues and insecurities about her own lack of progress in life which were exacerbated by my existence. I'd had another close friend who I'd been hoping would move here too, but who ended up picking a different city.

&#x200B;

Pretty much, I don't actually have a strong reason for being here aside from not wanting to pick up and move all over again. A vague sense of discontent doesn't seem like a good enough reason, especially when I worked so hard to make friends here and have spent hours exploring and researching neighborhoods and places here in an attempt to 'settle'.

What has made this city fun is the friends I’ve made and exploring the history and subcultures of this area with them. I’ve made friends through work (very carefully— I try to keep my personal and professional life separate), online, through my religious community, and niche interests. People don’t really smile or talk to strangers like they do back home, so I don’t find large events or festivals great ways to meet people. 

If I just moved here and didn’t know what to do, I’d look up DC on Atlas Obscura and have fun visiting these places with a buddy or two."

Now go-go music gets pushed because politicians really depend on that population to vote them back in and singing and dancing is a familiar bag of tricks.

Also makes sense when you go to r/Nova and everyone thinks Manassas is basically Baltimore, and PG county is about as safe as Mogadishu."
,,">  I'm a software developer and San Francisco was definitely the It place to be for that.

I mean, yeah, SF and NYC are the two places for that, but they also have the highest CoL, so it's up to you if that's worth it. The main thing I'd say about NYC is that their subway is S tier while I'd say DC's is A tier.  

I never went back to NYC post-pandemic, but I would also imagine that every city has been ""muted"" compared to pre-pandemic.  

Also it's kind of true that a lot of people only go to DC for work and live elsewhere."

I appreciate the purity/authenticity of it too.

,,"Ok hear me out — I come in 🕊️

But do you see how what you wrote can be exclusionary and basically reinforce what folks are trying to communicate here? A lot of DC locals are in very tight knit community and aren’t welcoming of newcomers. They are very much protective of what they hold dear and want to cherish it and not let others in that might dilute/change/hurt it. And I can 1000000% respect why and those deep feelings. But at the same time, you have to respect that some people will end up having a hard time finding community here. If they don’t have family or friends that are here for the long haul, they are left with a rotating cast of characters in their life and giant institutions (ex: Smithsonian) that cater to the masses but don’t cater to their community specifically. You can kind of be washed up in the in between. If I didn’t have my family and my religious community, I would feel adrift too because what isn’t big and generic is generally not a space I’m welcome or feel comfortable in. Or it something cool happens, it burns out quickly because it’s too costly to make stuff happen here. DIY and local doesn’t often survive for very long."
,,"I’m guessing your a majority culture person in other cities.  Sorry if this is an incorrect assumption, but your perspective shows some bias.  No local cultures in other cities speak for everyone.  DC’s culture and history has a lot to do with African American culture and history.  Just because you don’t feel bound to it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.  Same is true elsewhere where many aspects of the local culture are built for the majority, but if you are a member of that majority it may feel like it “speaks for everyone,” while it actually does not"
,,I had no idea about this soooo cool
,,That's culture for roller skaters. Not everyone in DC is a roller skater or can relate to that culture.
,,"genuinely asking if you’ve never heard of go-go? because yes it is pretty close to that lol. the genere is one of the best and most beautiful things to come out of this city. go-go and DC are more or less synonymous.

not to mention the fact that the hardcore scene that started in the 70s here was one of the first in the country. our own Bad Brains were the first hardcore punk band formed on the east coast. the 930 club is a national name. skim through Dischord Records’ roster and it’s like a greatest hits list.

the hardcore scene nowadays isn’t near where it was in its height for a few reasons, but go-go is still sort of a beating heart for this place."
,,"That has nothing to do with what I said. I am also not from DC. 

This is based on people claiming dc is soulless or has no culture. The fact someone can't find a fitting is more on that individual than the city.

It's not hard to find tge culture in dc. It just matters do YOU like it."
,,"This, too."
,,"Yep, if you would like to know more, reach out. Ill share Information with you"

My comment was for saying dc has no local culture which is egregious"
,,">go-go ... hardcore ... the 930 club ... Dischord

And Nation used to be a top spot for EDM artists to play at before it was called EDM.

ESL/Thievery Corp were a huge big name label and act.

Jazz, soul, and funk have deep DC roots.

The Black Cat was an important indie venue, co-founded by Dave Grohl (a NOVA native).

There's a lot of solid music culture and history in DC."
,,"DC punk/hard core  no longer exists. Those bands play BMore and Richmond now.

They build a gogo museum but do everything they can to make a real gogo illegal and gentrified the areas that produced the music. Gogo is now the sound of PG county and Alexandria; not DC. In DC the only accepted gogo is the smooth r&b version the rich Bammas like. There’s no beat your feet playing in downtown. Smh. DC is a town where artists come to see play; we don’t produce artists ourselves. We actually discourage it. DC music scene is soulless and dead."
,,“It’s pure… Only the right people know about it” That’s exclusionary. I agree that their comment sucks too.
,,Has no local culture that everyone can be part of is what I'm saying.
,,"I never knew that Thievery Corporation was from D.C, that’s news to me."
,,"Know about and accepted in to are 2 different things.

My point about that comment is its not commercialized or exploited. 

The people who are involved were introduced to or stumbled upon and fell in love. That's why I said what I said."

,,Yea they owned U st. Music Hall before it closed and because Privilege lounge lol. Which is basically a microcosm of what happened to the music scene in this area.

Moved here about 12 years ago, did one year in Arlington in between, and have been in Montgomery County MD (right by a metro stop, and still work in downtown DC) for the last 2ish years.  There is crime, traffic, and general craziness just like any other city, but for me the pros definitely outweigh the cons."
,,"No, this sub disproportionately complains about dogs, crime, and driving way more than anyone I have met in-person in DC."
,,"This sub is 50% people who don’t live here, 25% hating dogs, 20% crime and 5% good content"
,,"Assuming you are considering moving to DC, the city, and not the surrounding area.

Many posts criticizing or expressing dissatisfaction with DC contain at least a grain of truth. Try to strip away any tone to consider what is valued or being said and see if it still resonates. 

If you planning a move and throwing a dart at the map, and just show up in DC, there is a 50% chance you will be disappointed. 

Your DC experience depends on your values, interests, finances, intentions, and demographics.

DC has two faces. Professionally, this is a government and politics city. A lot of people move here with intention of furthering their career as part of a life plan they may have been born into. Small talk questions tend to be what do you do, who do you work for, where do you live, and do you own or rent?  The posts asking where to watch political debates or congressional hearings are real.  Personal real life interests can feel secondary. If you are arriving from the Midwest and you aren’t somehow interested in politics it can feel alienating.  

Locally and residentially, if you are looking to move into DC the city, it has changed a lot and continues to change. If you hope to buy and eventually own a home, DC is far more expensive than say Columbus. If you research you may find taxes and cost of living are known to be comparatively higher, too. 

In some condo buildings, HOA fees can cost as much as rent with little justification — it might be smarter to buy a home (if you can find one) and self-insure the maintenance/repairs that $1k+ monthly HOA fees supposedly offset. 

Anecdotally: As someone who as lived in DC for thirty years, there has always been tension among the city’s demographics and it has heightened. In the last 8 yrs I’ve become keenly aware that the person I know myself to be is not how I present to others. 
I’ve randomly experienced being threatened, shoulder checked, shouted at, and harassed while minding my own business going to/from the grocery and running errands — in the name of justice. Neighbors have shared they are experiencing this, too.

The DC city government currently skews left, and increasingly seems more principled than practical. Claiming to champion “real Washingtonians” is a nostalgic dog whistle (of a different kind) that ignores the city’s current demographics and history in macro. It also heightens tensions.

The city has been a destination for large peaceful protests. But political analysts claim DC will increasingly draw a more kinetic crowd like Portland and other places. After living here 30 yrs, and watching things organize online, that forecast seems more probable than possible. 

Culturally, the city is home to many colleges and museums which are great for broadening horizons. The restaurant scene can be trendy and expensive (like anywhere else). Local music venues like Anthem and 930 club attract well-known and up and coming acts. Rock Creek park is nice for watching the seasons change. 

DC is also centrally located among the east coast’s “megalopolis” and international airports which creates opportunity to explore when you are ready for that. 

TLDR; DC the city offers a lot of nice amenities. Culture is a toss up and favors youth seeking professional advancement. DC’s residential life can feel like a high maintenance dysfunctional friend. The cost of living, if you aren’t careful, can negate the advantages and set back your longer term financial goals — compared to living elsewhere."
,,"I would only go so far as to describe city subreddits as “less ridiculous than nextdoor.” lots of good info, but you have to take it with a grain of salt, especially when there’s brigading on hot button political stuff from people who don’t even live there. 

if you don’t know anyone who has lived here, i would say put a call out for friends of friends etc. actually talking to locals really helped me in the decision to move and getting oriented once i was new here. if you can visit, going to neighborhood coffee shops etc. and checking out the general vibe is helpful. personally, the thing i miss the most is the “weird”/subculture stuff that was much more prevalent in tucson, where i’m from. baltimore tends to be more my speed. (check out the visionary art museum!!) of course…don’t base your opinions of baltimore on -that- sub lol."
,,"DC is a wonderful city, and you should ignore most of the negativity in this subreddit except the part about how a lot of the cheap apartments on Craigslist are scams. Always see an apt in person before paying any application fees."
,,"No, the banter and focus you observe on reddit is not a proper reflection for this area (or really any area for that matter).  To put it in perspective, of my friends in DC, less than 10% of them are on reddit and thus their viewpoints are not reflected here."
,,"I moved from the Columbus area to DC a little over a year ago, one of the best decisions I ever made. It’s more than expensive but the resources, the culture, the food, the people, the WALKABILITY, make it worth it. The more residential sides almost remind me of the outskirts of Cincinnati, but if there was an effective bus system and restaurants that were actually interesting. You have to find your people (if you don’t anywhere will suck), but there are enough social clubs, volunteering opportunities, and work happy hours to make that happen for you. Best of luck escaping Ohio’s gravity!"
,,"Every city sub is like this. People love to go online to vent or complain. Do not get your first impressions about DC, or any other city, from its subreddit. 

That said, a lot of the negativity you see here comes from a real place. There are problems in DC: it's not all yuppies and monuments and brunch."
,,"I like living in DC and have only witnessed a very small smattering of the bad things people complain about all the time here.

Sometimes I feel like since DC attracts a lot of high strung, high achieving types, you see a lot of more people from that crowd posting about every single little thing that they see wrong with the city. 

It's a city. No city is perfect. DC is better than most other cities in terms of quality of life and livability. The mass transit is decent. Of course can things be better and can we do better? Yes. But that's utopia. There will be compromises. 

If you don't like it here, you can always go to a place that suits you better. I'd imagine most people on this subreddit are well-educated and are in skilled professions, so to do that isn't much of a stretch for many here."
,,"Moved here knowing where I was going. I am not disappointed. It’s a big city with the usual problems of big cities. It has major plusses. Moderate climate with 4 seasons. Fantastic cultural opportunities. International and diverse. Major sports. World class entertainment venues. Lovely green spaces. Iconic buildings and sculptures. Serviced by 3 major airports. 
I love it here as I approach a full decade. I have no plans to leave."
,,"I like to think of it like a Yelp review. People tend not to leave a review for an average experience, and usually not even for a great one. But have a negative experience at a restaurant, and you'd better believe that place is getting put on-blast for it. Which makes places look a little negative on-average as a result- people are prone to complaints more than praise in-general.

This is no different. The warts and flaws, everyone goes off about, but the good part sometimes get a little buried.

It has a lot of flaws as a city- housing is expensive, Metro is a disaster, tourist hordes can make it difficult to get around sometimes, etc... it's also got a lot of great things going for it.

Put another way, I moved here in the final days of 2006 and have never left. So it can't be TOO terrible. ;)"
,,"It's reddit, there's a bias towards grumpy people who share their thoughts behind a screen and not in person. Take that for what you will."
,,This subreddit is 100% accurate reflection of life in DC and the people. This is also true of the internet at large. ;)
,,"As many people have mentioned, we do maybe like to complain on the internet!

But also, we're complaining because we know DC can do better (and should do better).

Don't forget that if people have given up, they rarely bother to complain!"
,,I love DC. It is not perfect and I complain on the internet about the ways it is not perfect. But I love it in its imperfection.
,,"I love many things about DC, as much as I accept the negatives I've had to deal with (most of which have stemmed from not making enough money to live *well* in DC. Better now than before, but I'm still ignoring the reality that I can't buy property I'd want here unless I can significantly change salary or relationship status.) If you think you'll enjoy it and make enough money to have a fulfilling life here in the process, then absolutely come. If you think you'll love it but maybe can't stay long-term, it may still be worth renting here for a couple years, come try it for yourself! There's so many cultural activities, different groups of interesting people, good food options, and ways of living that make it a great place to live!"

,,"I was born in DC in 1951.  Moved to VA beach in 1959.  Years later returned to work. Having lived in Europe many years, I loved the diverse culture. DC is a small space. But Annapolis and Eastern Shore are close. Mountains along Blue Ridge Parkway are close.  Day to day you cope with living in a Federal city. President motorcades that block traffic. The bike paths are poorly engineered. My son was cut off in a bike path and fractured both elbows. You will need to live in an apartment unless you've got a million to spend on a home. Busses and taxis and Uber/Lyft are great but expensive. But a car is kind of useless. Any other questions?"
,,">a majority of the posts I see here have been negative

Yeah as a recent transplant that is how it seems, like every other post is someone getting carjacked by literal children or assaulted on the metro. It doesn't paint DC in the best light."
,,"Former Ohioan here, who also moved to DC after grad school - I love it here, for many reason, but mostly just the city itself. I love going for long walks with my dog, checking out different restaurants and going to museums. It’s a big city, yet drivable, it’s busy but not overwhelmingly so, theres always something interesting going on on the weekend. I find it’s a nice balance. And the weather is more mild than Ohio!"
,,"I live in No Virginia and have traveled a decent amount into DC

 I would recommend, if possible, to see if you spend a few days or a week or 2 with some friends or even rent an airbnb in DC to get a feel for the city.

 There can be lots of cool stuff if you really enjoy the urban vibe, but be cautioned the cost of living when looking at rent, food, going out, parking, et cetera is pre d*** high"
,,"I went to OSU and have a couple very good friends in Columbus still. The biggest downsides to here seem to be housing - $300k gets you a serviceable SFH in much of Columbus and a 1-bedroom condo here, and community - it's just something you have to actively work at here in a way you don't have to in Ohio. The crime feels higher than Columbus, but I think that's mostly because in DC you're likely out in public more, whereas CBus most people (understandably) just drive everywhere...I have to say though, I know MANY other Ohioans who are here, and I can think of maybe three people from the DMV who ended up in OH. Take that as you will"
,,"I love it here! Moved here in 2011 and still haven’t seen everything. This area is like having 3 states (I know DC is not one lol) at your fingertips at once and it’s awesome. Also close to PA, Jersey. North Carolina….and a four hour drive (or bus) to NYC. I grew up in upstate NY and while I’ve been to NYC many times, I still think it’s nice I can hop a ride and be there. There’s something for everyone here. I will say it’s super competitive here work and education wise and expensive, but you make what you want of your experience. 🙂"

,,"DC before the pandemic was a bustling, vibrant, beautiful city. Now it’s nothing like it was before 2020. And the voters this year killed the restaurant industry. Come July good servers and bartenders all will be going to work in Northern Virginia."
,,"There is a gap between local relative comparisons and global comparisons.

Although people are right that the internet likes to complain, there are other things going on here as well.

Ask the question: is DC a great place to live, you will get a resounding yes. There is a fair amount of selection bias in that answer of course but it is real. This answer is founded in a global comparison of places to live. Am I better off in the DC environment than Baltimore, Chicago, LA, etc. ?

Meanwhile the bitching about DC you see is actually a comment of local comparison or trend in time: are things getting worse or better locally. I think you are seeing evidence that things are getting worse in the city. The trends of cities nationally having problems is very much a pandemic related issue with many factors. DC isn't perhaps doing that much worse than others so again comparatively people will still want DC, but at the same time they are identifying a trend to the negative."
,,"DC is a large city, I wouldn't think any consensus would be meaningful. A lot of people are crochety, adoring, frustrated, and contented with the city. Also in my experience no city is going to be a good match for all people. 

I really like the city, but that opinion doesn't generate a ton of discussion. People that enjoy the city are largely out enjoying the city, not on this sub"
,,"I moved here 6 months ago. I really enjoy it. I came for a year of school, but will be staying afterward and for the foreseeable future. 

(I’m originally from Columbus too and imo you won’t regret moving here)

I feel like a lot of transplant residents with complaints hadn’t lived in a dense urban setting before moving here, and are surprised by the proximity to wealth disparity, crime, etc. it’s not worse (and in some cases arguably better) than any other major metro area in the country (NY, LA, Chicago, the bay, etc.)"

,,Reddit is not reality. The people in this subreddit are highly unrepresentative of DC residents as a whole.

It's not for everyone and there are very specific things people like to complain about... If you're a straight single woman trying to get into a serious relationship, it sounds like it kinda sucks for that. If you don't like politics or are super conservative you might not love it. But if you're a nerd with an impractical degree and delusions of grandeur, you'll fit right in!"
,,"In between the fun and helpful posts this sub sometimes feels like a weird hate-group of sorts. But the objects of hate are motorists, tourists, and people from nearby suburbs. Some of the people on here seem lonely and in need of friends.

TL/DR: No"

A women with a baby in a baby carriage are walking thru a cross walk. A wheel on the carriage breaks:

In NYC: people just help carry the baby carriage across.

In DC: people ask if you need help, then help carry the carriage across... if they have time.

In LA: people start up a nice conversation if you need help, provide suggestions, then continue on their way (while you move the carriage).

Currently live in LA, still have prop in Glover Park. Miss walking to everything, people like community IN DC; but LA, 100x more diverse, friendly strangers, more stuff to do. Both take 45min to get to say Dupont circle or Santa Monica."

I will say the public transportation is one of the best I’ve ever experienced, even if it’s still far from perfect (that’s more a USA problem than a dc problem). I’ve found great people here and a lot of resources that you couldn’t find in a lot of other places. If you like cities I think you’ll like dc"
,,I love DC and honestly i can't think of another city in the US I'd prefer to live in. DC has its problems and many of them are discussed here but i believe the benefits of the city vastly outweigh its issues.

,,I feel most ppl on this subReddit are younger and probably not native to the city. Just an observation.
,,I'd treat this sub similar to Next Door in terms of what you see posted. People are gonna be much more likely to post about their complaints than things they are happy about. DC is a wonderful city and has great culture if you get out of Downtown. I love DC and don't plan to move anytime soon

I have a feeling there is an effort to shit on DC by outsiders, but that's just a feeling I get from reading posts here."
,,"I live in DC, and participate in a few DC related message boards.  Given the political nature of Washington DC, sadly DC-related message boards are often the target of people who don't even live here, who want to attack and denigrate and demonize, who want to make DC seem like a complete cesspool of crime, out-of-control Karens imposing unhinged wokeness or whatever else.  And then there are the suburbanites, who project hate on DC because of the commute they've chosen for themselves.  They constantly start threads to complain about bike lanes and other things.  


We've lived in DC for almost 15 years, and enjoy it here.  It's very walkable, there is a lot of green space and tons of great activities and amenities.  I have a DC-area bucket list that has hundreds and hundreds of places to go and things to do which gives us fuel for every open weekend.  Is DC perfect?  No.  Sure, there's crime - but none of us has ever been the victim of crime in the 15 years we've lived here, and I rarely hear of any of our friends and neighbors becoming victims of crime either.  Yeah, there are some homeless people.  Many of the DCPS schools are notoriously bad, but we got lucky and got into a good charter, and our kid got into a great university with plenty of scholarship money.  Housing can be expensive.  Many restaurants are overpriced for what they provide.  There's always going to be things like that to complain about, but those aren't by any stretch unique to DC, you'll find the same situation in NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago, or other big cities as well."

I was recently robbed at knifepoint in broad daylight at my front door. There is plenty to complain about here. Gun violence is off the charts. Others terrorize drivers and walkers alike with dirt bikes, and the police have been told not to pursue them. And it's written off to DC culture. The culture of DC stinks."

It’s got everything you want - great food scene, walkable, public transportation, amazing museums, good music venues across the city and access to lots of biking/hiking opportunities.  wine country isn’t far (not Napa or Sonoma but won’t kill you either). And NYC is a train ride away!"

For born and raised like myself, this is home and we love our city.

,,DC resident now and have spent a lot of time in Columbus (grew up in Ohio and my brother went to OSU and lived there for a while after).  In my opinion if you like Columbus you’ll love DC. Vibes wise I’d say they definitely have similarities. Adams Morgan is N. High Street. Navy Yard is Short North. Probably like the Columbus subreddit crime gets amplified especially when it is in “nicer” areas. I have two small children and feel like the benefits of living here far outweigh any concerns about crime or the “negatives” that are often prevalent in the subreddit.

Oh and its a big  city so it has all the negatives of a big city: big rats, problematic public transit, sometimes crappy weather, expensive real estate, mean people, deadly incidents.  It also has cherry blossoms along a river in the spring, eagles, herons, parks, many FREE museums with WORLD CLASS exhibits, fun and funny people, a great Metro, findable decent apts.

,,"I lived in DC for over a decade after similarly graduating from grad school (though it was also in the District) before moving to the burbs during the summer 2022. DC is a great city that I highly recommend living in and of which I also miss living in. 

While living in DC, I complained as much as anyone about the Metro and occasionally about the council and crime rate. But that didn’t diminish my love of living in DC (except for having no representation in Congress). So, I’d recommend it in a heartbeat. If it weren’t for the impossibly high house prices, I would have stayed. That said, living fifteen minutes from
Baltimore has its perks; though it makes my morning commute to DC a pain in the ass. As much as I hated the metro at times, reading on the metro is far superior to being stuck in traffic.

As for this sub, it’s mostly a reflection of the mood. But I’d wager a lot of the crime posts (especially those that rip on statehood) are posted by outsiders."

,,"I have lived in DC since 2010, bought my house in 2013. I used to love DC and now I want to move to where people are kinder. I have seen people become meaner and more selfish. The crime has really increased in my neighborhood. For years, I would hear gunshots every few months. Now, and I am not exaggerating, there are nearby about every 2 weeks. A few months ago at 6pm a child was shot a few hundred ft from my house. One time I dropped to the floor bec the shots were so close and I didn’t know where they were coming from. 
I volunteer monthly and help out my neighbors and do other things to try to spread the love in DC.  Would I recommend someone moving to DC now, no. It doesn’t feel like the city I used to know."
,,"This subreddit is awful; I moved to DC 11 years ago for work. I left that job over 7 years ago and stayed because of how much I enjoy it here. Don't get me wrong it has issues, but it's what you make of it. Get out and explore, meet new people,  and be sure to eat at some of the unique restaurants around. Get out of the city too! DC is in such an advantageous spot; you can go to the beach, go camping, rock climbing, brewery/winery/ distillery hopping, there's so much history in the city and out of it. All this to say sure there's shitty parts just like any city, but it's not hard to find the lovely parts. I hope you guys give it a shot and enjoy it as much as I do!"

Other than actually spending time in a city, or having family/friends that live/lived there, it's difficult to get a local's take on what is good/bad, fun/boring, safe/dangerous in a city. Although reddit isn't best place for getting a feel on something, it provides easy access to hundreds of thousands of opinions, which I think can be useful, even if not the most representative."
,,"It's a lifestyle choice. Some people love the city for the walkability and density and closeness to museums or nightlife or whatever else floats their boat. Some people just prefer the suburbs. Some people love the city when they're young and single and then move to the suburbs when they want to buy a house with a yard and have kids in the public schools. Ymmv.

My suggestion is to start in the city and see if you like it. If you don't, it's easy to move when your lease is up. If you start in the burbs you'll never really know what you're missing."

Just my opinion. Overall, DC is a great, fun city with plenty to do."

I loved being in the city when I was young. I met friends, got married, explored and grew as a professional, and I still love going to the city for brunch or events. But as I get a bit older I like being outside of it. I own a house with a yard. I live in a beautiful, picturesque town with tons of outdoor activities. But I still can visit DC or Baltimore in about an hour.

My only point is you can't go wrong. Did you ever watch the last episode of The Office?

Creed Bratton : It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But no matter how to get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift of making that place their home."
,,Mentioned this in another thread but would try an Airbnb in places you’re interested in. Neighborhoods in DC vary widely although the burbs are a bit more consistent for larger swaths of area.
,,"For us, it was a purely financial decision -- we were buying our first place and were priced out of any DC neighborhood we would have wanted to live in.  We're in Rockville, which is a little farther, but I think somewhere like Bethesda or Arlington (where I lived for a while) is great.  Easy access to work and the resources of the city, but a little more chill of a place to come back to.  To be fair, at this point in my life I'm past the point where easily-accessible nightlife is a major factor; 5-6 years ago, I would have much rather been right in the middle of everything.

Edit: or Silver Spring!  Also a great and popular ""just over the border"" option!"

I’ve lived in the are for 25 years and I can say that as far as revitalizations of cities on the east coast during that time, dC is the winner.  It’s a fantastic city with so much to offer and the beauty is that virtually every part of the city is being used well and is vibrant."
,,"FWIW, I really enjoy living here — it took a while to get used to it, but there are so many upsides. Amazing public transit (compared to most of the US, not internationally), really convenient and walkable, pretty accessible, a lot open 24 hours, tons of free stuff to do, and sooooo much going on in the larger metro area too — whatever kind live music you’re into, it’s easy to find a show you like, etc. Of course the rent prices are a downside, but I’m also paid better than I was elsewhere so it’s still a net gain. And you’ll hear about crime, but I 100% feel safer than in Tucson — there’s just more people around if weird shit happens. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck with the move, wherever you land!"

,,"> City Council can be pro-walkability and build parking spots (that will cost $20/hr and eventually be moneymakers)

If parking spots are moneymakers then why aren't the private developers chomping at the bit to build them? They know exactly what they're doing asking DC to pay.  "
,,"And it *literally* was an either/or situation:

2) Let's spend money on improving metro and bus service so we get greater reliability and shorter headways.  

 Both of your complaints are fixable in the short term. Adding more parking is adding to a long term problem."
,,"The counter to that argument would be that they can simply park at one of the terminal stations where the land can be used to build substantial parking infrastructure and then use public transportation to access the downtown core. 
"
,,How much distance would it actually save? 
,,So the city only for those who take public transportation...ok.
,,"Ultimately it's underground parking paid by the taxes collected on the actual property there, in part to offset that parking can't be built under the historical spine of the market and that you have a University right next door to have parking influx.  The negative externalities here are minimal, and making it an issue strains credibility.

I have no idea what your talking about on the weekends, WMATA continually has 15-20 minute headways which will suddenly become half hour headways.  While they may have improved weekday service, getting it to the level of asking someone to drive to a station then take the train in isn't a reasonable request.  If we can improve reliability and increase rail coverage then we are talking, but we're talking a billion dollar venture compared to a couple million.  "
,,"I guess you have to decide if tourist dollars are important. If they are, you want to make it easy for them to spend them. If not important to the economy, its a moot point. "
,,"Hard to say, and it depends on the design selected and where you're walking from. Probably a little less than a quarter-mile--or four to five minutes. 

But it's not just the walking. It's also where you have to walk. The sidewalks underneath the bridge over Florida Ave are incredibly narrow, which is really discomforting when you're trying to pass someone, both with umbrellas in the rain, with traffic speeding past on the thoroughfare next to you. That path would become a shared Pedestrian/Bike path in the most recent plans I saw for the Florida Avenue Safety project which... would be even more terrible. The tunnel would have opened up that space for bikes to use more freely while pedestrians could instead (largely) use the tunnel for metro access."
,,"Public transportation and other modes of transit like cycling should certainly be prioritized over more automobile traffic. Piling more unfilled cars into a dense urban space is not an efficient way of moving people around, and all of these cars decrease the quality of life of people who actually live in the city.

DC is choking to death on traffic. Adding more parking is not going to solve the transportation problem – it will make it worse by encouraging more people to drive. We need to be looking at other solutions."
,,Many other cities around the world have no problem raking in tourist dollars despite the urban core being relatively inaccessible via car. 
,,"Ok but until this public transportation/cycling paradise shows itself what you say is nothing but wishes. Cars are popular because its the most efficient way of getting around with a city with DC's infrastructure, this is not NY.

Not 100%, but they often are, yeah. Transportation funds are finite. Road space is also finite. Putting in a bike lane or a dedicated bus lane to make biking or public transportation better means giving up driving space or parking. And cars take up a fuckton of space, so prioritizing using road space for bikes and transit increases the maximum throughput of humans (vs. vehicles)."
,,"> Also why are you assuming investment in both parking for overcrowded areas and improving metro are mutually exclusive?

in this case, those were literally two different avenues for this funding to be diverted to."
,,"> Cars are popular because its the most efficient way of getting around with a city with DC's infrastructure

Lol the fuck it is. 45 minutes by car. 20 minutes by bike. The city is flat as shit. It is, BY FAR, more efficient and faster to get around by bike/moped/scooter.

Maybe convenient/comfortable is what you are looking for."
,,"Gonna guess that Ward 7 and Ward 8 have the highest share of households that are considered families (as opposed to singles, group houses, group quarters, etc.). 

> What are the transit-friendly/walkable areas where people with young kids live?

Gotcha. I’d probably look at this in the inverse and go backwards from there. Where aren’t there a lot of kids? As you pointed out, U Street/Dupont/Logan Circle. H Street probably isn’t as kid oriented and maybe some areas around universities.

Much of DC has kids everywhere. Northern Columbia Heights and Mt. Pleasant has a huge number of kids and pretty good connectivity and it seems like the presence stretches all the way to Maryland whether that’s to Glen Echo or Hyattsville, though connectors drops."
,,Yeah 16th street heights (north of Petworth) seems to be similarly family oriented.
,,Lots of families in Cleveland Park and Van Ness.
,,Takoma/Shepherd Park/Manor Park has tons of families.
,,"I'd say anywhere that's primarily townhouses. Hill East, Capitol Hill, Petworth, Brookland (outside of where all the new condos and apartments are), Shaw (off the main streets), etc."
,,"Glover Park, tons of families. Makes house decorating for holidays awesome in the neighborhood"
,,Mt. Pleasant is not far from where you currently are and has a great neighborhood and community feel.
,,Petworth is pretty family oriented. Lots of families with younger kids there
,,Lots of families in the swath from Eckington through Bloomingdale and Truxton over to Shaw
,,>!Cap Hill has tons of families. Lincoln park area !<
,,Capitol Hill. It’s a wonderful neighborhood for families.
,,Depends on how rich they are
,,Maybe it has to do with the quality of public schools in various areas?
,,The places with the best schools nearby.
,,Most DC children are being raised in areas you are probably too afraid to enter.
,,Riggs Park. Not much to do up here but it keeps the houses more affordable than in interesting neighborhoods.
,,"FYI, I live two blocks south of H St NE, there are tons of families here, and I'm happily car-free."
,,"Brookland is very family heavy.  Lots of new homes going up too that probably will have a lot of new families, both near metro (technically Edgewood) and north of South Dakota (technically Michigan Park)."
,,And then between 2nd and 5th grade every one of them moves to Ward 3.
,,You need a lot of $ to afford a house there though.
,,"I'm from out of state, H st NE is long, is there  a landmark nearby to look at houses in the area?"
,,"Also, Brookland has the full housing stock with families in all types.  Townhouses, both new builds and old.  But also many single family homes with yards, which is a big part of the attraction for many families."
,,Where in DC is that not true?
,,"I'd triangulate between the Whole Foods or Giant on H Street NE, Union Station, Union Market, and Eastern Market. The latter three all have metro stations. We're within walking distance to everything on that list, it's great, and there are zillions of strollers everywhere. Both our next door neighbors have small children also. The Capital Hill Cluster Schools are the more ""desirable"" public schools FYI, some people aim to buy homes in bounds for those schools."
,,"East of the river, Trinidad, far NW like Michigan Park, etc."
,,Those are still lots of money.
