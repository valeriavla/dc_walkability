ive had different favorites as ive aged when i was young and first moved here i loved u street and adams morgan then i became fond of h street now that im old and no longer care about nightlife i am a big fan of georgetown kalorama and glover park
mt pleasant you go therelive there and you go really this place actually exists in the nations capital no way
im surprised no one has said capitol hill
mt pleasantxbi always said if i could buy property anywhere in the city it would be in mt pleasant there have consistently been like  of my favorite barsrestaurants within walking distance for as long as ive lived in dc  years and its quiet and its out of the way and it abuts rock creek park and i can catch a bustrain to almost anywhere in the city i would ever want to go
i love adams morgan theres something for everyone great food from all over the world top notch cocktail bars stand up comedy live music and dancing a michelin starred restaurant tennis courts basketball courts a soccer field multiple parks plenty of night life for the earlymid s crowd a short walk away from beautiful kalorama and low crime relative to a lot of other neighborhoods
my favorite neighborhoods are cleveland park mt pleasant and woodley park with mt pleasant being my favorite theyre simply beautiful centrally located and very walkable mt pleasant has the added bonus of a lot of food and grocery choices i like the other two cause theyre on the red line
kalorama has got to be one of the most gorgeous neighborhoods in the world cathedral heights and cleveland park are beautiful too
the neighborhoods i like the most i can afford the least
mt pleasant great community with a diverse main street and accessible transit
i love cleveland park its quiet friendly and safe and ive gotten to know my neighbors really well its not the coolest neighborhood but i love it here
 seems like there always gonna be someone hating some area i search for loli feel like half of these complaints are people holding on to whatever they were doing before theres no mexican food like southern california i cant park my car on the sidewalk like philadelphia there arent  beers like my midwest college town where industry left  years ago and the only economic driver left was the university go explore places and enjoy what you enjoy dont worry about other people
i like dupont circle and georgetown for their architecture and eateries
im seeing a lot of mt pleasant but how about takoma and brookland people are so friendly in both places in an already friendly city plus the housing there is pretty cool i just know these neighborhoods from biking through a bunch of times and they both feel like happening places to be lol lots of activities and close to the metro
    are all very nice i recommend renting a condo in an old building they have more character are better built large spaces high ceilings  hardwood floors  some have roof terrace newer construction is mostly cheaply built
ive lived in eckington ledroit park columbia heights eastern market and palisades i have close friends in petworth brookland benning h street logan circle navy yard carver langston and im probably forgetting or conflating some every single one has its charm different strokes for different folks absolutely but i would take any of them if i had a place to call home i even got to like college park when i first moved here in the summer and had to get downtown everyday in a suit this is an amazing area to live in full of its challenges but always worth it to me and yeah just because of all the other comments mt pleasant is dope
dupont it feels like a small town with a lot of charm and friendly people
started with georgetown and dupont about  yrs ago because they were easier to get to from where i lived then u st followed by h st petworth has been my favorite for a good  yrs now because its more relaxed
i live in clevelandwoodley park the zoning is technically wp but i spend more time in cp but id move to mt pleasant
i live in petworth and absolutely love it i only sort of knew it before i moved heremainly had just been to a couple places on upshur but its a really pleasant neighborhood with a great mix of people and its very quiet and friendly even though its an easy walk to several hotspots for bars and restaurants
michigan park  it wont get love from most  but it is very quiet the homes are getting upgraded and community is diverse  only thing lacking are good restaurants and store fronts
in terms of sheer beauty its definitely georgetown it is the best preserved neighborhood in dc and is full of beautiful trees and landscaping mt pleasant is also very cool and feels a bit like a village within the city out of all the dc neighborhoods mt pleasant feels the most hipster and grungy which is a nice change of speed for dc 
dupont
ill boost glover park i didnt know the neighborhood before i went apartment hunting and i grew up in arlington it doesnt have metro or nightlife but its a wonderful little community with many different incomes living together and close to nature and nightlife not too far away
south of lincoln park i love it here lots of lowdensity housing breaks up the noise ton of green space im young but i like the fact that there is a mix of families and single professionals it makes it feel more homey than noma where i felt a little claustrophobic with all the high density buildings
columbia heights
takoma
noma
fort totten metro  kennedy street is my hood and i fucking love it
i miss adams morgan so much when i lived there id also walk up to mt pleasant and daydream about living there were in sw and really love it too the proximity to the water is great its a great fit for us im also infatuated with brookland and would love for that to be our next move if we can swing it
i enjoy living in sw being fairly central yet pretty quiet aside from having few good food options which isnt usually a problem since i cook however i also find capitol hill super pleasant
navy yard has everything youd want in terms of restaurants and bars next to the nats and dc united and green line can get you to other neighborhoods very quickly not to mention the apartments are nice for the price than most other comparable units in the city
woodley park cleveland park clarendon in arlington
if i move into dc from the suburbs im moving to h st or mt pleasant
moved to petworth a few years ago and cannot say enough about it best neighborhood to raise a family in the city
the safest one
cleveland park kalorama adams morgan woodley park
its got its issues and im sure is not for everyone but i enjoy living here in chinatown
i have lived in fairfax va for  yr and its great im just south of herndon
my favorite neighborhood is any neighborhood that is outside the legal boundaries of dc
any part where theres no crime 
the inner nw ring of residential neighborhoods is so nice and so green and other than bars actually has a decent number of  amenities a favorite walk is to start in is to start on the georgetown waterfront walking north through burleith and glover park hit the cathedral and cut back down through cleveland and woodley park ending in kaloramaedit route httpsgooglmapssnvbewtexqtjd
east of rock creek park this would be my choice to live not including kalaroma cause you know its expensive
i think out of respect for mt pleasant people should not try to move there
people on reddit cant afford capitol hill
what are the good cocktail spots
philly and nyc transplants complaining about how clean it is here always gets me
yes love this and hate peoples attitude that are like this
yup yup i love it here glad to let go of the midwest and south i lived in before and immerse myself in the midatlantic almost two years here in the metro and it keeps getting better and better
brookland is low key great just chill enough with just enough to do too
thats basically not dc to a lot of people here id guess
brookland is slept on  theres a market good variety of restaurants good bars and unique architecture
 block of connecticut has some beautiful ones
i appreciate the neighborhood but i wouldnt say its got a smalltown vibe  at least not the small towns ive lived
nothing screams grungy like  million dollar row houses
moved to glover a few years ago after years in admocolumbia heights its definitely quiet lol but i appreciate how pretty it is how walkable it is and how my apartment is like x the size of my columbia heights apartment for the same price
i love it here 
i live in columbia heights just curious why you like it
why is it the best to raise a fam isnt upshur the only street to have good restaurants
why downvote its a good point
hol up whats your secret
except on reddit
thats a favorite nice weather run of mine wrapping back around to georgetown
oooooh i live in gp but havent done this as a loop before must try
basically all the white neigborhoods
surprisingly there are some older apartment buildings that are reasonably priced in the neighborhood
green zone is the best the rest in no particular order arejack rosethe imperialdram and grainrevelers hour sit at the bartiki on thgrand duchesscasa kantuta its brand new and i havent been yet but i want to try it
idk i guess yeah not enough love for ne
sedgwick and around tilden yes those were nicely built but have not been well maintained  one was in the news cuz of too many voucher residents there is a very large on the left going noth after porter on the left that must have great views of rock creek one of my favorites is on devonshire pl near  on california st nw a few too  or on connecticut south of tate bridge a few grand buildings
yeah i have friends in dupont and i like itdefinitely feels like a european city to me a lot of people spend some time in dupont or u st when they movelive in dcid say in terms of feeling like a small townive never felt that way about dupont because its a very hip place to live and has a ton of traffic coming in and out but dc in general has a small city vibe unlike other major cities so i can see what op is saying it probably is more friendly than some of the other downtown vibey neighborhoods like penn quarter or mount vernon etc
do you live here
lol
i like columbia heights a lot and the area around it its a neighbor that changes from block to block i walk everywhere and its an easy place to live without a car or bikethe neighborhood has something for everyone and theres always something going on my neighbors are friendly on warmer days a few neighbors sit outside hanging out and i find i spend  minutes talking to my neighbors often i share a beer on my stoop with them sometimes theres tons of parks close by as well as a pool in the summer with giant odd provisions street markets whole foods and even sonyas market really a bodega theres a lot of walkable places to get cheap and notcheap food quickly and easily theres a movie theater on u that has cheap tuesday showings there are great bars in the area they constantly change so theres always some place new to try buddys just opened on th and i like it wonderland has been around forever and its great for a cheap outdoor drink they have fun events all the time there is great food known nationally seven reasons queens english makan there is cheap food theres chain food when you crave itthere is howard university which is beautiful and has fun cheap events if remember to check most people forget it has a theater churches like all souls and the mt pleasant library are close by and help provide a nice way to get to know your neighbors places like bloombars and capoeira do cheap community events to bring young kids totheres a high school with a nice view of the city from its parking log
its just authentic adams morgan dupont is just lame in terms of originality idk theres pride in columbia heights
mostly because the streets are filled with families on my one block there are almost  kids and  families all in my age bracket its a very strong and tight knit community the houses are larger and you have more greenery with the big circles but you still can get downtown in  mins check out sherman circle around pm on a warm day and youd get it  nearly a hundred kids and their parents hanging around doing happy hour its urban bliss
the first grim reaper sent to claim him got hit by a buggy crossing an  lane road in tysons and every one since has been unable to cross any streets there to get him
something like this you can time it to startend at the farmers market on the weekendshttpsgooglmapssnvbewtexqtjd
yeah due to redlining and other racist policies other neighborhoods in dc have not received the same level of support one day id love to recommend a loop near ft dupont but there just arent the same level of clean paths bike lanes coffee shops and safety there we really should lobby our mayor for more policies to make that happenbtw i didnt recommend the whitest neighborhood spring valley
awesome thanks
i mean it is kind of out there looks like a nice throw back while driving thru though
the frontenac ponce de leon and whatever the one at  connecticut is called love those i have a thing for baux arts buildings
yes and ive lived in a towns of  and  people  they aint close
really appreciate your reply we moved here  years ago from georgia we lived in a suburb outside of atlanta purely for work reasons hated the place knew nothing about dc  luckily found a great realtor who recommended columbia heights so glad he did your description of what makes the neighborhood great is spot on
redlining most neighborhoods eotr used to be white
i love spring valley 
maybe takoma but brookland is like a  min bus ride to u streetunion marketh st idk why people say its far like from what
and the kennedy warrenme too but the problem with northern connecticut is those buildings with green or yellow facade in bathroom tile  nyc subway also tiled but looks greatmy son lives on ponce de leon ave ne in atlantabuilding from 
ok in these small towns would u know the owners and workers in different stores
and they still are the nicest parts of eotr redlining explains investment from  but they never had a rating of a grades and almost all the h grade housing was eotr using federal gov nomenclature all a and b grade housing was west of th streetsee here httpswwwdcpolicycenterorgpublicationsmappingsegregationfha
if its not a  minute walk from where the millennial yuppies live its far ie anything not dupont or admo or shaw adjacent
having the two farragut connected would be amazing
many metrorail stations had provisions built into them for future entrances the provision in the bethesda station is being used to connect that station to the purple line both farragut stations have provisions for for a future tunnel that would connect them to one another greensboro and spring hill have provisions that would allow their entrance pavilions to connect to the second floor of an adjacent future building mclean has a provision for a future entrance on the north side opposite of the existing street level entrance archive has a provision for a second mezzanine on the south end of the station with surface entrances on the south side of constitution avenue lenfant plaza has a provision for second surface entrance on the west side of th street at maryland avenue pentagon city has a provision for a second mezzanine on the south end of the station with surface entrances at s th st navy yard has a provision for a second surface entrance on the south side of m street at new jersey avenue woodley park  zoo has a provision for second surface surface entrance on the east side of connecticut avenue
here is the official wmata document for the nomaunion market tunnel feasibility studyhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadnomafeasibilitystudyfinalreportandengassessmentpdfhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadnomafeasibilitystudyfinalreportandengassessmentpdfit includes renderings tunnel schematics and suchthey produced a similar document for a metro centergallery place connection in  httpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadgallerymetrocenternoappendicespdfhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadgallerymetrocenternoappendicespdf and a document for the farragut tunnel project in  httpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadtaskfinalreportpdfhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadtaskfinalreportpdf theres also was a plan circa  to eventually construct a second entrance in foggy bottomhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadfoggybottomfinalpdfhttpswwwwmatacominitiativesplansuploadfoggybottomfinalpdf
the fact that many stations have only a single entrance or two is one of my frustrations with metro in dc  because of its inability to decide if it wants to be metro or commuter it has long platforms  if you only give a single entrance many people may need to walk across practically the whole station but above ground to get to the entrance wasting several minutes of time  crossing streets is another one  lets not even talk about the silver line stations where you have to walk across a bridge over the interstate thats practically longer than the distance between stationsa lot of the systems i find best tend to have at least four entrances per new metro station two on either side of the road close to the front and back ends of the platforms with the line aligned to a major street  this substantially reduces the perceived distance to a station from any point in the city  so i for one really welcome these changes but hope they do more
im just glad everybody is still calling it crystal city
id love to see a metro entrance from the metro branch trail if possible  the noma station has  good entrances theres also hardly a line at the faregates because so many people are experienced at jumping them
i personally am very happy that there are the options to live in new apartments versus a lot of the rental nonsense ive dealt with previously there is a lot of demand so it is good that the supply is catching up
deleted
there was a plan to add a second entrance at ccy that would emerge at crystal drive
the crystal city metro entrance was part of the original development plan to lure amzn
its wild how much noma the wharf and navy yard have grown  but when i go by those buildings nobody seems to be inside many of them
it took them  years to build a canopy for the north dupont exit ill file this under things i wish we could have but wont happen
sounds unlikely to me
new york ave noma is already an extra station some of us remember when that wasnt there
so what on earth are they building behind the target up there at the end of glebe if this js just now getting funded
they are virtually connected if you exit one station and enter the other within i think  minutes the farecard system treats you like you never left a tunnel would be cool but i think theres just too much infrastructure to work around to make it feasible
that farragut connector is something ive always thought would make a lot of sense
ive always thought it was odd that cleveland park and van ness got an entrance on both sides of conn ave but woodley park only got a single western entrance despite having higher ridership than both stations and being in a livelier areathe knockout panels are quite visible at archives and pentagon city
federal triangle has a knockout panel in case they tore down the old post office building
i wonder if that new entrance to the navy yard station will be incorporated into whatever they build on that vacant lot south of m that seems like one of the last parcels of land where construction isnt either imminent or in progress right now
this is awesome thanksxbcurious what the noma circulator talk is about
nala is just stupid imprecise name for one its quite a distance from one point to the other so just using the nearest metro stops name makes way more sense second why is everything here named national like the national landing is across the potomac from the national harbor neither of which are all that great anymore for mooring larger ships
its unbelievably frustrating that theres only one tiny cramped staircase for anyone north of florida ave in eckington to reach the metro entrance they deconstructed the ramp for some construction project on florida too
the north one has a lot more faregates
a second crystal city entrance is already in the design phase if i remember correctly this was all part of the amazon package httpswwwarlingtonvausgovernmentprojectsprojecttypestransportationprojectscrystalcitymetrostationsecondentrance
a lot of the buildings in noma havent started renting yet but the ones that have are absolutely packedeven comparing to last year theres a lot more foot traffic than there used to be
the vacancy rate on these units is almost always under 
sometimes things change hope that helped
stations didnt exist since the beginning of time what a revelation 
this is a very funny gripe from someone with stuck on the redline flair are you stuck on the redline because of your principled stand against using extra stations
an entirely new station potomac yards it is being funded along with the of city of alexandria and some developers i think after its finished that target plaza will be redeveloped eventually
its actually  minutes enough time to stop for a sandwich according to the official metro website 
 a tunnel would be cooli never understood why this isnt a tunnel from metro center to gallery placechinatown i would save people time going from bos to yg
well they have the virtual tunnel now that allows you to exit on station and enter the other for free so i doubt that theyll ever spend the money to make an actual tunnel unfortunately
farragut was supposed to be one station originally nps objected to trees being cut down in farragut square so then we get two stations and the trees were cut down anyway later
during the time the station was being planed the east side of connecticut avenue did not have sufficient traffic to justify a second east side of connecticut avenue surface entrance the passageway to the east surface entrance would connect in the right side of passagewayhttpsgooglmapsjynexdabyukqce at the bottom of surface entrance escalators and the top of the escalators that descend to the mezzanine
it would seem very expensive to dig a second entrance given how deep the station is at woodley park
yes along with a segment of a partly built passagewayhttpsgooglmapslvkgmbsbhsyufa from the north mezzanine in union station to a future entrance at h street there are likely others provisions that i have forgotten about or are not aware of
the ramp as in the wooden one that was only put there recently and it was always meant to be temporary im assuming whatever theyre building in its place will have a more permanent solution
theres also an elevator thats perpetually out of order as well better than nothing but theres room for improvement

citation required
no not in noma the new open buildings are over  full
""
and yet i was charged recently despite spending no less than  minutes outside
they do that in moscow and its both very confusing and extremely helpful
at least its something i suppose
there sort of is if you count the elevator
okay thats many months down the line though
that elevator has literally never worked the dozens of times ive tried to use it with my son in his stroller
theres a pedestrian tunnel to get to that side but yes they need more faregates
 vacancy rate or  occupancy rate
did you check your card history online it charges you initially then gets reconciled nightly or at some cadence i believe
i mean thats just an accessibility requirement but also i would advocate for a new elevator over a new entrance the current elevator goes so slow compared to the one in rosslyn which seems double the speed you can only ride it down  times every ten minutes which requires you to have to come pretty early to not miss your train
there looks to be enough space to turn that area into a ramp more capacity and it makes things easier to transport all the things that roll
 full
dont you also have to leave from a particular exit for it to work id heard that but am not too sure
i totally agree its one of the few places that i often see a line at the elevator outside of the main transfer stations because the zoo is so close there are a lot of parents with strollers which makes the elevator line back up
thats exactly what the other person was saying
thats a  vacancy rate
being able to walk and bike everywhere has some pretty insane saving benefits   i used to sell fixed up bikes regularly and had a spreadsheet to calculate the amount saved per trip whether that would be driving commuting or avoiding a cabuberlyft in most cases a month of bikingwalking versus using a car you would start seeing the savings benefit
tl dr my personal experience definitely agrees ive lived in urban areas for the last  years between two different cities after moving out of the suburbs  cityliving has definitely been more costeffective especially because ive never wanted a large property or a yard i have to spend an entire afternoon or pay someone to care for it  carrelated expenses alone save close to k a year and im not even including gas in that equation i have all the routine needs within block radius from groceries bus stop and metro station bank dry cleaners gym barber my local bar etc etc beyond the moneysavings its also a huge time saver which for me is more valuable i cant remember the last time i circled around the block to find parking going out with friends means metro freebus or uber and im there in  minutes  when i used to commute to tysons via metro i worked out a deal with my employer that i would start working on the train so i was all caught up with work emails and docs to read by the time i got to the office on a typical day i worked  hours at the office and left at pmish every day on my way home i read for pleasure get home at pm at the gym by pm shower at home cook eat clean up and id still have threeplus hours of free time
i have noticed the same and will add that as i get older i notice the time savings much more so than the financial savings you can spend more time on the things that are important to you if you dont have to factor in significant travel time or expense to do them walking the kids two blocks to school is a dream also tending to a larger house and a yard is a huge investment of time
been in the dc area about  years no car that whole timeedit you can easily live car free here even with a family its more expensive than in the burbs but very doable
as someone whos been in dc for about a decade now i absolutely agree i have friends who have houses some out in fairfax and others back in fl where im from and i will  say that while i love their space i love the fact that im able to walk out of my building and be in the city need to go to a store i can go directly downstairs need to go to a theater or bar im a quick min walk or metro ride away from some cool places at the end of the day ill take a smaller place in a city over a house at the end of the day
im just going to drop a stream of consciousness ramble here i stayed in dc throughout the pandemic and remember how apocalyptic it seemed in the first weeks i remember working from home in my window alcove and watching a neighbor load up their station wagon to the point it was almost touching the ground as they headed for the hills never to return and taking walks around deserted and ominous streets and then of course came the protestsunrest that summer watching guardsmen in riot gear roll by that same window and the bizarre nights like picking up my wife from her frontline healthcare job and getting home just as the curfew took effect lincoln park deserted before pm and then later walking down to the capitol on  to see with my own eyes you know my ass wasnt missing history of that magnitude the terrible events of the dayi guess if theres a point to all that its that it felt like sort of a reward for keeping the faith and believing in dcs future that we were able to become homeowners during this period everybody was acting like the city was dead and so prices were nuts for single family homes but that sort of gave me the opportunity to slide in and  unbelievably  find not just a condo but an actual kingofmycastle rowhouse we could just barely afford it aint much but for a couple of kids who grew up in trailer parks in the rural south it is pretty damn amazing and its not big but after years of living together in literally one room with a murphy bed if i wanted to stay up late id go and sit in the bathroom floor because it was the only separate room in the place  even  sq ft is amazing and ive found it helps encourage me to prune our stuff more often ive never lived in a proper house in the suburbs but the idea now feels me with dread to be isolated in a big house behind a big lawn where im filling all the extra space with junk i dont really need just to fill it i dont have much of a backyard to speak of but i always say i dont need one because the national mall is like americas front lawn and its my backyard
also dc has universal pk starting at pk this is a massive savings for families since daycare costs around k to k a year
dc is cheap if you live car free and avoid pricey activities which is easy thanks to how much free stuff is here and even easier if you dont drink
deleted
i also feel the same way i dont own a car nor a foodie or a drinker ive been able to live on my own for the first time in my life a goal ever since i had disaster roommates and am okay with the tradeoffs
the cost of living shouldnt be just the cost of the mortgagerent it should be calculated as that cost  transportation  upkeepi feel like people here go out there and buy pretty large and cheap relatively speaking houses in the suburbs without realizing they also have to keep the house in good shape and usually need multiple cars to drive long distancesi live in a  bed condo with my partner and we only have one small hatchback we dont really need it tbh but we have a parking spot we already had the car before moving here and its nice to use it on the weekends upkeep is also cheaper because the place is smaller and can walkbikeuse transit to almost anywhere we have toif we compare our situation to some of our friends they have a larger house with a cheaper mortgage but they spend more on upkeep utilities need two cars and drive longer distances pretty sure we come up almost even on our monthly expensesit also comes down to how much space you need but realistically i think most peoples houses are waaaaay bigger than they actually need
my wife and i share a tiny apartment in downtown silver spring a few blocks from the border been there over  years can confirm its cheap and it works
yes i pay just a little bit more in rent than i was because i have since acquired a dog but the number of free events across the city the location close to other major metro areas that you can access by a bus or train and the fact that the city is filled with other type a intellectually curious people  its a big change from where i grew up
from the  consumer expenditure surveyamericans spent an average of  of their total expenditures on transportation meaning mostly cars and  on housing in other words as long as your housing budget doesnt increase by that entire savings youre better off
second this something else to note about having less spaceyou quickly find its just liveable if not more so than having plenty of it my last place before dc was significantly larger walkin closet own bathroom large common space etc it was so big that i just kinda sprawled everything out why organize anything when theres plenty of space when i moved to dc though the downsizing forced me to be organized quicklyif i didnt id have no room i quickly sorted my stuff and i found that having less space pushed me to be more efficient and intentional with not just how i organized my things but how i lived in generalwe as humans adapt to fill the space were in no matter its sizewe expand and contract as needed less space can be a blessing in disguise especially considering the benefits you get from city living
alsothink about all the health benefits from walking too damn if every time i take people on a tour when theyre in town talking same age peers people from my home town they have no stamina for what i consider normal daily walkingobviously you can work that in anywhere but i think it is a practical benefit
if you want a cheaper cost and still have the benefits of major city living in the northeast theres no better pick than philly
unfortunately this doesnt always hold true once you have kid and have to consider their school it can be difficult to live in a  bedroom dwelling near a metro station or along a highfrequency bus line within a good school boundarywe have built a lot of housing over the past decade but most has been  or  bedroom which means the price of  bedroom dwellings has continued to increase at high rates it is difficult to fit a family of  with highschoolage kids in a  bedroom dwelling
 sort of true i lived without a car in a small college town preamazon  everything i needed really was walking distance  i imagine most americans understand that experience even if they hate cities however for local examples you could theoretically live in downtown richmond or baltimoreor even frederick or charlottesville near the train line and grocery and live without a car for even cheaper also note  supervisors or project ownersstakeholders ive met in my years here lives in virginia or maryland  especially if they have a family  they may have money in dc real estatepied a terre or investment rental but they tend to want the luxury car and pool lifestyle
my rent on a similar sized placebr  sq ft went from    when i moved from a midsized city definitely not equaled out in cost by mass transitwalkability
moving to dc soon and doing this math for myself i think having a shorter commute by metro or foot will offset the higher costs but my spouse is not convinced
this is not necessarily my concern since i own a home in the suburbs but i honestly can appreciate what you are saying there is a lot to be said for participating in cultural activities as well as easily going out to restaurants
owning a car in dc does not have to be expensive if its an oldcheap car insurance will be cheap especially because youll be driving fewer miles  a parking permit and registration combined are under  for two years i probably spent  annually for a street parked vehicle which is well worth it for easy access to the soup dumplings at bobs shanghai and other forays in and outside of the city
the benefits of living in a city are unbeatable dc even has a state park to access but price wise its cheaper to live anywhere else yeah bigger space would be the same price but you can find smaller apartments for cheaper and a lot of people get priced out of cities
i think the rent increase  car costs doesnt work out for many folks unless they majorly downsize or join a shared houseapartment most of the folks i know also struggle to stay disciplined with their free activities and not eating out goals
youll own nothing and like it
yeah i agree that its actually not all that more expensive to live here my rent from  in texas to  here but i also dont live in texas anymore there were barely any public services or free things to do ill pay the state income tax and rent increase to not live thereand i got a new car so i am paying some for a car but registration and insurance is actually cheaper here than where i live in texas insurance was really high there im someone who likes the freedom of a car and can afford one so ive made that choice street parking is cheap here too it hasnt been a burden and i take public transit depending on what im doing i live closer to work so im not spending time on commuting i have made that a priority since starting work after law school wherever ive lived the time i get back in my day has also been very valuable to me im way less stressed too living here is definitely worth it and the value is there for me
essentially my experience when i first moved from suburban baltimore and a twobedroom apartment to a studio in dc
yeah ive found that spending less money on things saves me money too
how old are you do you have aspirations for marriage children
tell me you dont have kids without telling me you dont have kids
or just you know move to a cheaper area and enjoy larger space with enough money left over for carrelated expenses
me personally i have no student loans and i own my car and i pay under  for the top floor in my townhouse i have  roommates im probably in my own category
another thing is that the rent is higher but its for a better apartment  apartments in the suburbs suck they invariably have thin wooden walls and also have a lot of loud children  if you manage to find an apartment with solid walls in the suburbs and good luck with that youll find its much more expensive than the typical prices andor has a waitlist months long
also the pay for jobs in dc is usually higher than other mid to small cities so we have a good local purchasing power
cars are expensive to have and maintain not just in terms of money but time the most important resource for anyone at almost any life stage many folks wind up with small parts to replace here and there in addition to the mere need to service it tail lights can go out knobs can break someone can ding the body etcwalking is good for you at basically any adult age not being able to go to the store in  minutes forces you to batch your trips together better to be more efficient and so forth we should be careful to not confuse conveniences for comforts
moved from slc to dc  months ago paying  more per month for an extra bedroom in an english basement in columbia heights sold out car when we left slc and are never going back just immagine how much more affordable dc would be if single room occupancy units were allowed through zoning
and with a roommate too and in an old walkup super super cheap
thats not even to mention the health benefits of exercising as your means of getting place to place  i biked all over philly during college and had to drop like an extra  calories a day from my diet in order not to balloon once i got a job that required me to drive  im by no means sedentary but my step count is half of what it was plus im not also biking  miles a day any more  i frankly miss it
this is precisely why im wanting to get an electric bike it would eliminate gas costs from my commute for around half the year the only reason i dont use a regular bike is because no matter which way i go to and from work i have at least two hills i have to climb and thats not fun even when i was a lot more fit
not to mention saving on medical bills down the road
my job is out in tysons also and i commute twice a month via the metro the goal is to get a car next year and i still dont see myself driving out there alot idk driving around here can be alot and the metro is pretty useful
x we walk to daycare and work the daycare is across the street from my office plus free pk next year the kid gets a big park across the street too suburbs and cars seem like such a time sink for us maybe ill reconsider one day but the current setup seems pretty goodplus when they get old enough i wont have to act as a chauffeur
i would feel so claustrophobic without a car but it does seem like it would have great benefits especially here where owning a car opens you up to so many problems theft high registration costs parking traffic nightmares horrible drivers theft and more theft
i live in largo carfree but its becoming annoying going grocery shopping and to the doctors without one the goal is to buy a hybrid in 
cheaper yet if you live in your car
yeah my dad spends k often k just on gas per yearhttpsiimgurcombwrxrwzpng   i love my ebike because in terms of maintenance it just requires oiling the chain every  miles bicycle insurance is also way cheaper too
some people forget to factor in depreciation of a car but dropping value is absolutely part of the costi moved back to this area in  after many years out west including socal and was completely over having to drive everywhere i gave my car to my daughter in portland and get everywhere on public transportation yes even buses by foot or on my bicycle i really dislike cars so this is greatby the way my citymapper app that i use to move around without a car records how much carbon dioxide im saving how many extra calories im burning and how much money im saving by not using a car its very encouraging to see those numbers
haha ironically im actually very type b but i appreciate the type as for helping pull me away from my type b tendencies lol
yup if you walk or bike you can be pretty ok with  of your spending on housing by us standards
this is so true last year i moved from a bedroom with a huge amount of storage to a bedroom with a roommate that had maybe a quarter of the storage space  and even less of that was available because of what my roommate was already using sorting through stuff before and after the move i realized just how much i had bought just because i had the space to store it in my bedroomi definitely miss having that space but it felt so good to be able to donatesellgive away so much ive also really cut back on what i impulse buy
tell us more about walking not being facetious im interested in hearing more from your perspective
i really wantneed to explore philly more especially on bike
gotta compare like for like there is no price difference in housing across western or eastern ave nor significant school differences except on one side you get free pk and pk
where did you move from

dc is one of the few cities in the us where you can live  car free give it a go if you hate it you can always get a car
i have a newer car and its not even that bad insurance is less here than what i paid in texas a street parking sticker is cheap registration really isnt bad there is plenty of parking around my apartment i got a car and its been wonderful to have i agree that having a car in dc isnt actually all that expensive id argue it costs less here than most places in the us
if one lives in a newer apartment building parking is  a month minimum ymmv but another fear for me if an old car is the chance of breaking down or having to fix a timing belt new car or no car for me i just dont like the unpredictability of an older car
sweet spot is suburbs on a metro line
god forbid we enjoy the benefits of big city infrastructure communism strikes again
 no not really but i do understand that if i did and required more space this would be a very different reality i should have put in for single people in my post haha
problem with this is the lack of social activities to the extent there is in dc when i would visit a boyfriend in the suburbs we would just go to target for fun
i cant wrap my mind around choosing total cardependency as a lifestyle upgrade
with enough money left over for carrelated expenseswhich would negate the cost savings plus having to drive everywhere
terrible idea
you dont need that much space unless you have kids maybe im with op  a smaller space in a vibrant city
for real when my job switched to remote for the pandemic and i didnt have my daily commute ride i easily put on my covid 
i used to bike about  miles a day between ages  and  as commute to school university then work then i moved to usasuburbia i gained close to  pounds in the decade i am here 
i bike and i feel you also drivers tend not to give a flying fuck with us cyclists
same i could bike to work but i dont want to deal with the sweat risk i got an electric scooter instead and its lifechanging
my future cardiologist will thank me
maybe just live a little closer to tysons arlington is basically dc light and its so close to both you will be doing great
i think it really starts paying off for the kids once they get to middle school age and can just walk home from after school activities and go where they want to go going to their performances doesnt take up the whole day my friends in the burbs are constantly picking up and dropping off killing time at strip malls because it would take just as much time to drive home and back etc
also general maintenance issues if you dont use the car very much
i always just rented a car whenever i needed one if you do it only a few times per month its basically cheaper than paying for a car and all the associated expenses especially parking and insurance around here
interesting a car is basically a capsule where i tend to feel claustrophobic also owning a car anywhere exposes you to theft registration costs parking fees heavy traffic law enforcement terrible drivers etc
why would you feel claustrophobic try to see how often you actually need to use a car vs how often you are using one because you cant be bothered to walk or take the metro
how is that food category that cheap does he own a farm thats less than  a day

were here for you 
just basic cardiovascular aspects of it i get the impression when i travel as with what i said above that a lot of people in many parts of the us dont walk very far in the normal course of their lives i used to work at a big national organization and we had this discount program for health insurance that gave points for various things one was walking  miles a day or something you could track with fitbits which they gave out reports came in highlighting successes and the org heads based in chicago were actually questioning dc office results on walking  except for those with medical exceptions people in the audience regular all staff meeting were all like thats just part of our regular commute plus picking up kids
i am not a bicyclist but my impression is the biking infrastructure is much better in dc so thats definitely a plus in dcs favor
correct both sides of western and eastern ave are expensive largely detached homes neither dc nor montgomery county are building enough family housing
nebraska
ah theres that coastal condescension that really strengthens us as a country and helps bridge social divides
thats where i moved to  might pay a little more to live closer since those  hour metro rides are killing me
i loved living in my little boxes in walkable cool neighborhoods during my s getting married and growing older has me wanting more space and not be around as many people i am not rich and cannot buy a million dollar condo or townhome in one of those cool walkable neighborhoods i am left to seek more space like millions of other americans in those car dependent locations unfortunately i dont want to live in a  sqft apartment and i want a garage to work on my hobbies for all but the wealthy privileged people here its simply not attainable and requires tradeoffs like everything does
yeah im a carhaver in the city but its far from my main mode of transportation its not uncommon for me to go two months between getting gas and every time i end up in rush hour traffic i remember why i very deliberately choose not to live somewhere that im actually cardependent
oh but you get more space and a car both of which provide significant utility
oh come on  the covid the pun was right there
yo sameso glad im not alone
i biked more once i could more easily duck out an hour early and get a couple of hours in on the bike or use my hour lunch on my trainer and then eating whenever
arlington sucks
lol no thanks virginia is a place is all ill say
ive never understood how my exurban colleagues schedules work out i mean if you add it all up between kids errands and commuting they lose like  hours a day for me home  daycare  work  daycare  playground  groceries  home takes like  min total for me toss in a few more errands just a few more minutes of commuting time do they not sleepedit i was wrong  min includes me saying bye to the kiddo and time in the grocery store checkoutless thank the robot overlords according to google it is more like  min on my bike for  miles for all legs
depends on the car if youve got a big payment on it then renting comes out ahead but if its paid off then that line item is  my parking is  and insurance is  could be less without full coverage maintenance is minimal and gas is still an expense with renting call it mo to own with maintenance factored ini use it almost every weekend at least once to get out to a hobby location golf skiing hiking primarily and almost never during the week but i have it when i do need it and also have complete freedom for driving to iad or bwi or to other cities for day or weekend trips im not one who sees any justification for spending money on a new vehicle when my  rav does everything i need it to but renting could make more sense if i just had to be in a new one all the time
true but this place feels exceptionally insane with car jacking and theft compared to other cities maybe statistically thats wrong and i just feel different here i have driven all over the us and ive never come across as many selfishly terrible drivers as here as well on top of that maybe i have gotten lucky with where ive lived but every city and town i have been ive never had to pay to park outside my own home before these are all just personal experiences though so someone else may have a different perspective on owning a car in dc
because i like being able to get out of the urban environment at will
the claustrophobic feeling would stem from having to rely on others to get where i need to go and those places needing to be in specific locations adjacent to public transportation i personally just like having a car to know i can get where i need to when i need to i definitely understand those that dont want one because there are lots of negatives to having a car as well and thats great if you can do everything you want to without one
costco and sams club are under shopping the food category is really just restaurants according to thishttpswwwredditcomrchasecommentspabristhereawaytochangethecategoryfora its set by the card merchants and chase doesnt allow you to change it   httpsimgurcomadqykmhq

philly biking infrastructure is lacking compared to dc significantly and somehow their streets are worse its still a great city to bike in though 
was nebraska not walkable 
so much natural beauty driving on  does suck though

the alternative is live in the city but not on a metro line heck ward  even becomes quasiaffordable by dmv standards then
i want a garage to work on my hobbiesthis part i dont have kids and i live in dc part time and sf the rest of the time one of the worst parts of each city is not having enough space to do very normal hobbies im not talking about big woodworking projects anything that requires an open area and more than a hand full of supplies or equipment is largely impossiblei guess if your idea of recreation is entirely socialactivitiesexperiences or whateverfocused dc is finehonestly in sf i have a balcony and generally nice weather which gives me more options for basically the same rent and general walkabilitydc has museums and small enough you can walk to another state if you were really motivated advantage but it feels like an outsized college town
you are right this only works for me currently because i am single and have no family but in the future im positive my feelings will change in terms of space
i live in a sf condo a house is over sf
i wish it was only  pounds
how would you know youve only been like  minutes into it
 but if its paid off then that line item is thats not right you have to account for the depreciation that comes from simply owning a vehicle that loses value over time and the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in that depreciating asset maybe by amortizing the purchase price over the useful life of that carif you have k tied up in a paid off car that loses k per year in value and youd be able to earn  in an alternative investment thats essentially an implied cost of year for continuing to own that car its oversimplified but demonstrates what im sayingso if the cost of car ownership around here is month thats basically  rentals at  maybe you need a car more than  days per month but not everyone does
a car is ultimately a money pit
i dont understand your perspective but its not surprising the idea that public transport is somehow onerous to use or limiting is  a factor of our carcentric society this idea of car  freedom is ridiculous since you cant just drive on whatever you want and park wherever you want in reality both modes of transport have their pros and cons and can be used together
that sucksalso how do you or your family find temu to be is there much concern its operated on chinese servers and that they have been noted as being difficult to get full refunds on given they do partial to prevent credit issuers from saying it wasnt done
well it is very flat it has that going for it
honestly cant tell if this is sarcastic or not
oh absolutely prettiest parts of the state are well off the interstate
its  man billys cousin moved in after that divorce
eh dont be so sure there are lots of us with families  kids who still deeply love living in the city living a few blocks from daycare and all our kids friends being able to bike to the zoo or a dozen different playgrounds or museums whenever we want being able to get to a park by walking a block or two living in the city with family can be great but the person above is right that it isnt cheap and isnt attainable for everybody
you dont have to be a wealthy person to live carfree with a family in dc dont buy into this idea that when you grow up you have to move to the suburbs
youre right from a perfect personal financial balance sheet perspective but opportunity cost like that isnt something i nor anyone ive ever talked money with factors into their monthly budget actual cash flow is how i plan and i wont speak for everyone but i feel confident in saying most people do too my line item for car payment is  but its still there because there was a time i was paying for it and may come a time again where i take one on how would one put car depreciation in a personal cash flow spreadsheet people arent companies who have to perfectly account to gaap fwiw i dont include the value of my vehicle or any other personal possessions in my personal balance sheet either yes im understating my net worth as a result
im assuming my dad finds it to be fine considering he continues to keep ordering from them but it also seems like he hasnt returned anything to them
deleted
find a  bed bath  sqft town or sfh with a garage for under k that is not in the hood and is in a walkable neighborhood id be pleasantly surprised
 actual cash flow is how i planthen just extend out the time frame were talking about if you pay k in cash once every  years to replace your car thats still cash flow or if you get a year car loan once every  years same thing so instead of saying that im renting a car once or twice a month ill just say i rent a car  to  times in that year period and were still comparing costs over similar timeframes accounting is just a method for making those comparisons but no matter what youre still talking about money being spentcar ownership is expensive renting a car is a potential alternative if your usage style and rate makes that a favorable financial decision regardless of whether youve paid off the car or not after all selling a k car thats already been paid off is k in positive cash flow right then and there if budgeting is tight that can make a huge difference
i lived in the citieslincoln and omaha k and k population so not really rural transition was basically what i expected had some friends who lived here before so was pretty familiar i love the metro and not having to drive most weeks definitely miss the open spaces though
youre also not going to find a rolex for  but you can certainly find a  bedroom condo for k or you could rent a townhouse
back to my point though those things are compromises i dont want a condo and dont want to rent anymore therefore looking for better opportunities i can afford for less compromise
sure to some having to drive a car everywhere is a bigger compromise
i read through the  page pdf technical appendixso they factor in nontraffic interactions with police but not crime rates in those census tracts they posit that the chance of a police encounter makes one less likely to walk what about the chance of being victimized by a criminalso they have all these categories where they say its worse for black people but then they go ahead and add a whole additional metric where the overall scores theyre assigning are pushed higher by a score based solely on having fewer whites in the census tract then they factor in disability but they take it further than the wheelchairs their footnote was citing and score against a neighborhood based on how many people have any disability in the broadest sense and then consider those neighborhoods less walkableim also still wondering if they factored in pedestrian behavior beyond intoxication with respect to tolerance for risk and crossing unlawfully when writing about it racial disparities in pedestrian deathsits just really interesting to me when you dig down into this stuff how easy it appears for study authors to goose the results to say whatever they want like they added a farmers market score but as far as i can tell not a grocery store score not that i dont doubt there are disparities in walkability but this is an incredibly expansive use of the term
lmfaooo
are you referring to the race score in the equity index they calculated the point difference from the white nonhispanic citywide share in a particular census tract eg a tract is  white itd have a score of  with the reference that less white neighborhoods have greater exposure to traffic more pedestrians and less pedestrian infrastructure this seems like double dipping to me considering this is what theyre measuring in dc an additional metric to measure the same level of under service but i dont know enough about walkability literature to truly make that claimthe whole thing reads like urban got paid to read some literature and play around in arcgis which is so much content that makes it news publications a better analysis would be local political inaction that prevents pedestrian infrastructure construction but that doesnt make urban any money and its significantly more difficult
yes thats what im talking about and double dipping is kinda how i felt
urban is generally speaking a straight a shooter as it gets in advocacy a little bent but not as bad as it could be that being said you could do what they do yourself in your choice of gis environment its not like the data arent publicitd be neat to show how layering factors on changes the score thats what i tend to do when i probe this stuff
 itd be neat to show how layering factors on changes the score thats what i tend to do when i probe this stuffeh early in my career i had to read critiques of someone who basically had a cottage industry of making z scores for cities almost no city was comparable to each other and each score was basically a scoring for what neighborhoods the city valued despite the stated purpose of each metric not being that in general yeah its interesting to see what drives the values in a given tract but i cant help but feel a little apathetic with these types of analyses
decomposing risk scoring is generally pretty valuable because if you can figure out how a firm is pricing risk you can bet against their blind spot but if i were actually going to build a proper risk score that i trusted id look at their inputs and then do an elastic net to see what parameters matter and how much my layering method is more to reverse engineer their model not really test the model quality beyond qualitative judgments
its good to be reminded that cars are legitimately the best option sometimes we need to do a better job at providing better alternatives in all parts of the city
i dont think anyone would hate on you for needing to drive a car we just hate that anyone is forced into this reliance because of automobilecentric city planning and the fact that certain neighborhoods esp in se have been continuously shortchanged from having better transit options
op every time i think about the fact that there was supposed to be a streetcar from navy yard to bolling and beyond i feel so gaslit like i remember the tracks i remember seeing them testing the cars i even remember there being a terminal station like off benning am i the only one did i imagine it related i wish they would finishdevelop the bike trail from the tm bridge to mlk and other points south id love to be able to ride my bike on a singular path to national harbor on the dcmd side but i cant figure it out its so beautiful out there poop plant not withstanding
most people dont really have a problem with cars they have a problem with entitled drivers that drive dangerously with complete disregard for the community believe their chosen form of transportation should take priority over all others at all times and believe any type of road design or enforcement that encourages safer driving is some kind of affront to their right to drivepeople have also invented this complete lie that access to public transportation is some sort of luxury for wealthy and cool areas its totally bizarrei live eotr but choose to live somewhere convenient to public transportation i need to use my car often to do basic chores or even to get around the city to meet up with people do i want to ban cars no but do i think we need to further prioritize buses cyclists and pedestrians at the expense of cars yes that would make the city a better place even for neighborhoods like mine
anticar sentiment shouldnt mean everybody who drives a car is an asshole but rather people shouldnt have to rely on cars to get aroundanticar sentiment should be directed towards investing in car alternatives  improving bus schedules subsidizing trains bike lanes etc
unfortunately mayor bowsers latest budget cancels the new circulator route that was planned for se along with  of the current routesalso unclear on if there will be funding for the expanded  hour bus service and bus route improvements were moving in the wrong direction
reliable transportation is the number  way for people to get out of poverty i never give anyone issues for buying a car when it is in their best financial interestthe real problem is that se was just obliterated by car infrastructure in a way that the rest of the city wasnt the   and  separate car dependent dc from walkable dc
deleted
yup it is not a universal dc experience to have multiple grocery stores and transit options near your apartment its also very difficult to take transit shopping when you are caring for small children
i am one of those people that would fall into your anticar sentiment group but my sentiment isnt that you own a car its that the area you live in all but forces you to own a car and thats just acceptable i dont think in most instances public transit is as fast as a car its about having affordableenvironmental options if a car works best for you do what you have to im just frustrated that your options are so limited and youre placed into this predicament
yep in the same boat in fort davistrips that might take an hour on buses take  minutes in a car this is quite literally my commute to work when im not wfh office is  min straight shot from home
i dont bash people for having cars thats fine i bash them for operating those cars illegally
its also worth pointing out that car ownership is actually lowest in southeast people driving cars when they dont need to slow down buses which means folks in se who use buses at much higher rates than other folks are stuck in traffic speeding up bus traffic by deprioritizing car traffic is actually more equitable for residents in wards  and 
thats honestly the biggest issue with eotr like i moved here  years ago and its really just the fact that eotr is underserved and underfunded if the level of public transit and accessibility that exists in the northern half existed in the southern half cars would definitely not be as much of a necessity
if your street doesnt have restricted parking or if you have kids or a disability or a job that isnt easily accessible or a job that requires you to be on call or friends and family outside of the city well you probably wantneed a car  or whatever reason you want  get a car  just dont get one of those big ass no visibility trucks that cant squeeze by  lanes of traffic or park
i work in se and theres a fair number of neighborhoods that are food deserts the system has been unfair to yall in that area as a whole congrats on your car op youre doing amazingly 
i sold my car  years ago and havent replaced it while i can get around with metro there are a lot of huge inconveniences to not having a car access to outdoorsy activities road trips dating anyone not off a metro larger grocery hauls cant even imagine if you have a family
im pretty anticar but se folks defense need cars however you se residents deserve so much better you deserve reliable public transportation destinations close by a sense of safety the ability to not need a car
i remember when i lived in soufeas years ago and my car broke down id routinely walk all the way to benning rd station to get to work because the w would be a too packed or b late as hell its tough living on that side without a car
lets not kid ourselves there are huge chunks of ne and nw that are also carcentric
i used to work in smart growthtransit advocacy i abandoned it because the perspective of people like op was completely dismissed the attitude of my colleagues was just people should be wealthy and live in desirable areas with lots of amenities within walking distance i didnt find that to be a viable position
theres a lot of anti car sentiment on this sub and it makes me assume that many of the people here are able bodied males who arent responsible for things like childcare or grocery shopping dont wear heels or skirts to work and arent burdened with extra responsibilities other than getting to and from work theyre either single and have no responsibilities or have a wife doing those things for them the idea of taking care of all my responsibilities via some convoluted metro bus and ebike route is laughable
the point is you shouldnt have to afford a car to have a better life people who cannot afford cars deserve a great life as wellwe want to transform the city to be inclusive easy to traverse without a huge private investment of peoples financeswe realize cars are essential in se we want to change that we want them to be optional not a necessity
also there are tons of things to do outside of dc proper that are just impossiblevery annoying to get to without a car the anticar sentiment on this sub is frankly idiotic
aint it some shit that dmv charges some nw prices for vehicle  registration and especially residential parking permits for us folks  eotr  ward  automobiles move every few weeks other than street sweeping days it seems   eotr vehicles move every day   ive still not seen a street sweeper eotr except for leaf day once a year   but sure enough they ticket twice a week like the sweepers coming
same in parts of nw too nearest metro stop to me is like a  min walk
what i hate most about cars is the fact that i need to own one i just want the choice to be able to take a trip without a car that doesnt double or quadruple the transit time
i got a shitload of downvotes for saying that i avoid dc because i dont want to drive around there with a bunch of comments saying to use public transportation as someone who used public transportation all over europe america does not make it easy to use public transportation every city here needs to have its own public transport map with all the lines on it and where they go
cars slow down and delay busses if there were less space dedicated to cars and more to public transit the bus could be so much better and more efficient
im just baffled by the strivers that get the c leases yet cant afford to live closer to workmetro to work or why one would buy a car over two decades old because they insist on a luxury car the maintenance and hassle of repairsreliability on a  yo s would cost more than the note on a new car once ones credit is straightened outthen again im a transplant with a single japanese car that we bought new thats  years old dinged up and well keep another  years or so before the repairs get bad what do i know
i used to practice at a medical office in se  did house calls the lack of easy transportation was a huge issue for many of my elderly chronically ill patients i had several patients who required oxygen  carried small portable tanks there was only  so much o  they could carry being physically limited to begin with so the time intensive process of taking the bus metro access or walking time made them risk running out of oxygen by the time they arrived at the office much less getting home yes i know oxygen concentrators exist but many of my patients struggled to get any oxygen during covid even if they had insurance to cover a portable concentrator snow cold or rain was also hazardous and discouraged many from attending visits because waiting at a bus stop is hardly as easy as waiting at a metro station those of us who can use alternative methods of transport should since its unbelievably helpful for the environment but thats a privilege and we need to consider equity as well when we have these discussions ill also add that ive done home visits in all parts of dc se was by far the most welcoming and had decent visitor parking
my issue with the anti car sentiment is that most of the discussions seem to focus on making driving punitive versus making other options more accessible and convenienttheres also the fact that if youre a lifelong resident your connections family friends etc have sprawled into areas that just arent accessible by anything other than car
yeah its not about the individuals its about the system that designed the places we live over the course of like a century being this way many places that dont even have bus service at all or sidewalks even
this isnt just a se thing  its true for most of of wards     and you can likedislike that this is the way the city is built but the reality is that you cant live a normal life in huge swaths of the city without a car
youre not telling us anything we dont already know  we know the metro doesnt serve large amounts of the city and thats a problem
theres a lot is privilege that goes into car discussions
i live in the palisades i would be screwed without a car
fwiw i think many of us in the anticar camp recognize how inaccessible transit is for many people  i mean yikes we dont even have a hour system and that in itself perpetuates car culture especially for folks who work earlylate shifts i volunteer somewhere where the shifts start at  both for staff and volunteers on weekends the metro doesnt even open until  and so people either have to be lucky enough to live near the bus line or have to drive i hate that the infrastructure within the district or lack there ofpersonally i dont judge individuals who have cars heck i recently got rid of mine after having it in dc for years but i do wish that the city was structured and designed in such a way that people didnt have to rely on cars take traveling eastwest vice versa yes theres the bus system which is great but there should be metrorail systems that connect areas like cleveland park to mt pleasant those are just random examplesi certainly wont diss folks who rely on their car to survive but i will criticize the infrastructure in place that makes people think im going to drive to the tidal basin instead of taking metro bc thats more convenient lol
thanks for this often times people are not considering thr folks who do not have the luxuries of being in close proximity to so many amenities they forget that many of the ppl who work the establishments they enjoy have to cross the bridge to get there they shouldnt have to totally diminish their quality of life to enhance anothers
se and pg county is very underserved when it comes to metro and public transportation how they scale the metro map doesnt really show it either youd think the south end of green line goes out as far as any of the other lines when its maybe half the distance from the city then theres a much bigger gap between green and bluesilver eotr than there is the rest of the area really shitty because thats the part of the city that could benefit most from good public transportation
this is high key a very elitist thread lmao yall are crazy
i cant believe you bought your first car as a  year old mercedes i desperately hope you have the funds and resources to maintain an k car
ward  has the fewest car owners in the city though talk to the city council about why they abandoned a streetcar that was already under construction in ward  while building a huge network of interchanges to accommodate the douglass bridge in the poorest and most transit dependent part of the city
glad to see this post as many residents dont have the same access to public transportation as folks in the wealthier  transplanty areas of dc
theres a natural gentrification element to anticar activism dc was always very much a car culture for decades the problem is that a lot of anticar people also think of themselves as antigentrification so its jarring for them to see these two parts of their selfimage in conflict its a complicated issue for sure but i get the feeling a lot of long time dc natives mostly black arent fully onboard with the idea that they are assholes for owning death machines which is the way it often gets portrayed around this sub and other social platforms
deleted
the part that gets me is that its not even really the dc cars that are the problem its mdva cars  when im out and about during a rush hour i have been taking note of the plates and its  mdva plates and the rest are dc and from outside of the dmv  and then the mdva drivers complain about the dc traffic when its their traffic  we here in the city arent the ones causing the traffic problems its people from the suburbs  and its usually md cars that i see driving like maniacs  like dude  your commute is not and should not be my problem
having stayed awhile in south east dc with family i found it better to use an electric bike in large parts of it just because of street parking being dangerous and dc traffic being garbage now for family they need cars but for singles maybe a bike would be a better option as it help connects the last few miles to the metro to get wherever you want this is of course my experience and people may not share it but it is worth exploring especially since ebike rebate programs are coming to dc
yuuuuuuup  same with ne  i live  minute walk from a metro stop but unless im commuting downtown it doesnt take me anywhere i really need to go  and the last mile solutions are basically nonexistent  we have commuter rail here in dc but aside from that use case if you need to run an errand or something public transit is x more time consuming  not to mention the psychic damage you incur taking it half the time i wish it wasnt this way  when i lived in west end i barely used my car  walked to pretty much everything i needed  now i go through a tank of gas a week and incur psychic damage because the drivers here are unhinged  sucks  but im in sqft instead of sqft for the same price 
if the transit to se sucks maybe elect a councilmember that will kick ass and take names to provide you with those services instead of being concerned about jewish space lasers
i dont get the point of this post you can already drive around dc easily you cant get around by transit easily you already have what you need if youre a driver its the other infrastructure that needs to catch up
definitely need those areas to be more dense and to have more public transit city neglected the outskirts in ne and se time to turn that around
totally get it thanks for the perspective
we sedc residents
im moving to dc this summer and very much debating if my car is coming with me
i dont blame you one bit what you need to do for you trumps someone elses opinion where does the anticar influence come from
im in congress heights and i dont find a car as a nessacity whatsoever where im at you can catch  different buses that all connect to metro there are  different stations here congress heights southern ave and anacostia i also can walk to congress heights metro within  minutes never have to wait more  minutes for a bus arrival i use uber for groceries for other rare occasions i may get a zip car or a rental i also work remote so i save a ton of money by foregoing a car the only reason i would see the need of a car is if i worked in career that required me to have one
obvious bait is obvious
im sure your inbox is absolutely slammed but thank you for saying this some of the folks here desperately need a reality check
i walk  i drive  i bike  i metrobus  its just that when i drive i treat it like im driving a lb death machine which i am  i simply do not see even a modicum of that care in many other drivers
i think your general point is fine lots of the dmv is not wellserved by public transportation but you would also refuse to pay  for the metro even if it did serve you which seems to undermine your point of course driving somewhere is going to be faster than taking the train that is the case in most cities but fact of the matter is your old mercedesbenz is expelling a ton of pollution into the air and youre creating a danger to pedestrians so dc shouldnt be bending over backwards by providing free city parking etc you should have to pay for the luxury of driving many poor people live in se dc and cant afford a mercedesbenz
i wish there were fewer cars overall but the ban all cars perspective definitely comes from a position of privilege similar to the people who cant imagine that shutting down critical arteries for yuppies to play in the street could possibly pose a serious problem for anybody
was your argument really missing the flex about your vehicle kinda dickish man
i dislike scooters on sidewalks most of all especially the guy who yelled behind as if i have eyes in the back of my head and as if he had any entitlement to the sidewalk on his scooter
yes youve identified a universal problem  working class folks in most cities and most counties often live outside of city centres or outside the city altogether while rich folks live in the center of town or near train stations at the same time rich folks are often the ones calling for using less cars more bikes and more public transportation to fight climate change and for other reasons also i firmly believe that people who prefer cars over public transportation or bikes should not be apologizing to anyone this is a free country this is a capitalist country you should be able to do whatever you want with the money you earn i hate public transport its crowded i hate waiting for the bus or train you have no control whatsoever in big cities like dc you also end up standing up for almost an hour during rush hour because there arent enough seats whats the benefit of that and lets not even start talking about crime like a couple of friends of mine who got mugged over the years in the subway in nyc or metro in dc as an adult youre no longer to take the bus everyday i feel its kinda emasculating like i had to take the bus when i was a teenager i dont have to take the bus anymore talk about the nanny state

nobody is blaming the people who are reliant on a car we are blaming the system for making people reliant on a car
people on reddit show the most disconnect from real life they love comparing europe model of lesser cars but were american cities ever designed or zoned for this transit sucks and is unsafe for most cities specifically speaking commute to dc is more expensive for me via transit than straight up driving not mentioning the time savedeven obtaining basic groceries require ii social gatherings on weekends require cars they love speaking about how great europe is and how dumb americans are but are we really to blame when the entire infrastructure is made so that public transport is not well maintained and unsafe literally no one will stand up for this issue ever at places where it matters yet they speak like expertsyou are doing nothing wrong cars are not a luxury but a necessity in american infrastructure
""
particularly in congress heightstrips that might take an hour on buses take  minutes in a car i can actually get to navyard in under  mins as opposted to taking the bus and waiting  minscongress heights metro station and the navy yard are  stops apart it would absolutely take longer to drive between congress heights and the navy yard than it would to use the metroi agree that parts of se like neighborhoods off pennsylvania and near fort circle park are definitely under served however anacostia barry farms and congress heights have good public transportation options
part of a car removal process is to ensure that every part of a city has adequate access to public transit so its not just ban all cars its replace car dependent infrastructurethat being said cars should absolutely be banned in dc never seen worse drivers in any city in my life nearly get proper hit at least once a week as a pedestrian
i would love a car free city but metro is completely inadequate for that
i think the fact that people are forced to have cars in a major city is part of what people are criticizingcomplaining about
i lived in congress heights for like  years a car is nice there but it could easily be made super bike able since congress heights is a lower income area bikes are a perfect fit to help a lot of people easily get around for really cheap to get from congress heights metro to navy is a pretty easy bike ride nowadaysi forgot to mention how fucking awful the sidewalks are in the congress heights area those seriously need to fixed asap
i think that most people who are anti car understand that we cant just ban cars we need to significantly invest in public transit first that buses and trains must be a preferable alternative based on cost transit time and convenience before we can think about how to limit their use in the city
i think the core argument is almost always safetyconvenience more people are killedinjured by cars in wards  than anywhere else in dc east of the river is basically covered in highways so yeah cars are super prioritized over there which makes walkingbikingtransit worse
as someone wh ois staunchly against cars and speak out about it often i know it sometimes comes off as hating car usersthose that are dependent on cars and whil i do think some people are intentionally irresponsible in their vehicles the most important impulse of the anticar movement should always be eliminating the need for cars making public transit and cities transit oriented so that people dont have to own carsxbse dc is no difference its frankly a failure of teh city government and in many ways an intentional abdication of the citys responsibility to provide cheap reliable accessible and convenient form of public transit i pray that se dc will have that and be freed from its extremely damaging dependence on cars
you see the more this post is hated on then the more weight it holds
all im hearing here is that bus service needs to be increased in se
cars are bad  car focused urban planning is badone of the major reasons that car focused urban planning is bad is that it forces people to drive cars  if youre not able to get around or comfortably survive without a car thats an urban planning failuretheres a world of difference between driving a car because the public transit options are practically workable and driving a car because fuck your trains i wanna drive
now this is a quality shitpost
i tend to ignore anticar folks better safer more fuel efficient cars yes  but everyone should take trainsbuses people have no clue what theyre talking about
jfc auto lobbyist posting on here now alongside police union shills
also sorry but i dont want to get raped or assaulted on the metro especially since the security is nonexistent
the bikedc bancars people are a pestilence upon us all like a blood rainmetrorail is most available and dense in nw and even there a smaller area if the metro map was to scale youd see vast areas of dc especially in se and ne lack access to metrorail without at least one bus trip
thank you for your insight uidontfuckwitchcondoms
enjoy that car
dont hate the driver hate the car dependency everything you say is true and we need to make noncar transportation better especially in areas like congress heights

plus walking around out here too much gets you robbed eventually
as a brit living in dc i cant help but feel the transport is lacking  as the capital i naturally compare it to london which is perhaps unfair but life without a car here is certainly not enjoyable
the problem isnt cars it is the expectation of how far a car has to take you our cities were designed to move cars through in huge numbers at high speeds people live enormous distances from essential things for reasons driving mph and being respectful of cyclists isnt the problem its the roads and drivers that expect to fly from dc to warrenton in  minutes
i think the anticar sentiment is moreso all these suvs and trucks in downtown parts of dc and people driving recklessly or forcing pedestrianscyclists into traffic not so much geared towards people who actually need them and drive responsiblyi have had two close callsboth times i was in a protected bike laneand i have seen three pedestrians get hit or bumped at a crosswalk this year alone i think that is the source of the anticar sentiment imo i dont judge anyone for drivingi judge people when they pull their  ton suv into a bike line or hit a pedestrian running a light
brought the receipts in that edit
really most place on the outskirts of dc need cars
and also as we can tell from your timeline biking simply isnt an option when the weather turns brutally cold as it did last december
yes cars are necessary for some people the point is to make it so its not mandatory to own a car to live your daily life we get you might be in the exception categorynice job biking as much as you do keep it up
dcs bipolar wether has never been worth the risk of not having a car
yeah man i agree  i live in marshall heights and the only reason my wife and i are able to live comfortably out here is with bc of my car we used to live in ne by h st  and i  still used my car a lot over there you could totally get away with not having a car but now that im across the river and in se its def needed i used to go to whole foods on h st before moving now we drive a little further and hit wegmans in md its been totally great for usps highly  recommended switching to an ev and going fully electric dc offers incredible incentives
look the point is if we had better cheaper public transit options wed never think over getting cars but were screwed and this was our best option i know its sacrilegious but sometimes its just the better optionhey man i get where youre coming from but this is literally the focus of the vast majority of anticar activism in dc we believe that its absolutely not fair that you dont have better options for transportation thats why we want to increase those options by improving transit walking and biking access infrastructure that inherently requires building more bike bus and other transit lanes as densifying locations and improving sidewalk experiences those things all cant be done without taking space away from cars since cars get the vast overwhelming amount of our public spacewe dont blame you for living in a cardependent area and using a car because you have to so long as you dont stand in the way when people try to change that reality by adding bike lanes bus lanes transit lanes wider sidewalks or slower speedsthe problem here is that many people will use this argument lots of people have no option other than a car as an excuse to further entrench the carcentric status quo that just isnt right
did you see this cnbc videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbmjdeageg it covers luxury apartments mainly in dc and literally came out yesterday
this is kind of a strawman complaint though noanticarpropublic transit people arent advocating that we focus on areas without good public transit access and then ban them from using cars and do nothing elsethe focus is on gradually transforming our infrastructure to make walkingbikingtaking public transit far easier and more viable than they are currently as a way replacing some amount of carscar infrastructure but youd be strategic about how you do it you wouldnt just leave marginalizedlow income people suddenly without a way of getting aroundamerica is sooooooooo hyper car oriented right now were long overdue for a pushback and public campaign towards fewer cars and more public transportation and walkablebikable cities but were still miles and miles and miles away from a point where we need to be worried that our cities arent car friendly enough
im in ne i drive to herndon everyday for work the metro takes me two hours the toll road takes me one agree with you  about needing a car and i would not move back to herndon or closer because all the black  early somethings are in dc or md its not cheaper to have a bike ive ridden the metro from the deanwood station to wiehle reston pre silver line expansion and to innovation avenue post expansion the metro is as expensive as a car if im just going to and from work  a month   a ride twice a day x a week and that only assumes im going to  building per day and not visiting other sites which i have to also doesnt include grocery runs errands and the costs of ubers when im staying out late and the metro closespublic transit metroubers is expensive when you start to add all the totals and you live in ne or se people in nwsw always seem to forget that
it would be nice if everyone could put themselves in anothers shoes without judging agree everyone has different needs and limitsi think that the dc reddit page is so overwhelmingly prometro in a weird way like if you say something bad about metro you get whipped i cannot stand metro and i dont have a car but i still support those who choose to drive because well metro kind of 
hmmm  the reason cars are the best option in ops case is because that is how the se was designedwe design cities and we choose to exclude se from metro expansions and densification the answer to that is not to build the city for cars to suit the se or georgetown but to prioritize public transit
yep my sis and bil are getting ready for twins in brooklyn they had to buy a car last month
we need two more lines inner circle from georgetown to logan circle to noma to capitol hill to navy yard and outer circle connecting the red line running through ne and eotr perpendicular to the green and bluesilver lines
eh my commute is  miles from shady grove station and i ride an ebike home you can see herehttpsimgurcomauexmgyy ive rode my ebike x as much as ive ridden in a car  given the layout of dc id actually argue that ebikes are probably a more optimal solution i know a lot of people in dc use escooters as a last mile solution  for example from georgetown hospital to farragut north its  minutes by bus but  minutes by conventional bicycle and also  minutes by car its  miles bike and  miles by car id argue an ebike would be faster than that  minutes  edit man its wild how many people are being rude and attacking me for a simple suggestion why this suggestion because i grew up poor and i know the value of money to a poor person and i also know how expensive cars are im literally not against disabled people owning cars or taking paratransit just to clear that up in fact a lot of ebikes have helped disabled veterans fwiw  its exactly like notjustbikes said  httpswwwredditcomrnotjustbikescommentszxurthisisnotrfuckcarsjznsiy   yeah there is absolutely overlap between the two subs and that makes sense because well fuck cars amirite although i do drive sometimes i also acknowledge that cars are the source of a lot of problems in our cities        one of the things i find difficult is communicating with americans because the us is so wildly extreme in its cardependence that its hard to have an intelligent conversation about it if im talking to say a german person about reducing carusage i can make some very reasonable propositions that would be considered mindbogglingly extreme in the us my recent video about amsterdam removing parking spaces is a good example i mostly documented actual policies being implemented by a democraticallyelected government but when it hit the youtube algorithm in america and was posted to americancentric forums like reddit youd think i proposed murdering everyones dog and forcing them to march to the gulags and to be totally blunt i want to continue to talk about these issues in a european context because us urbanism is a dumpster fire and i dont want european cities sitting on their laurels just because theyre so much better than the worlds worst example i understand that there are a lot of advocates out there trying to change us cities for the better and i appreciate them and their work but i personally have given up on us cities i dont really have an interest in talking about the us except as a warning to europeans who see the suburbs in movies and have a nave view of what theyre actually like
its rare for cars to legimitately be the best option in an urban environment the only reason they even compete with mass transit is the enormous investment that has gone into car centric infrastructure and the underinvestment in our cities transit infrastructure
in the entire country
i have no background on the topic but i often wonder if buses is a good lower hanging fruit since it doesnt require you know digging up the ground
i think this is most peoples opinionits a shame that the design of the city makes it the most convenient option for you to have to own one op it doesnt make it your fault
yeah despite people hating on the sub this is exactly what rfuckcars is about  httpswwwredditcomrfuckcarscommentshmytthoughtsithinkthisisanimportantideato   despite the name the subreddit is less about hating cars and more about hating the car dependent society weve created obviously most americans need cars but only because things are designed that way
there actually is a lot of hate in this sub for people who have a car for any reason if your reason is your work is not metro accessible people will literally say get another job like its that easy
nw west of the park is just as bad tbh kind of difficult to shortchange rich folks though i guess
somewhy not move to ne dc tenleytown
id be shocked if the streetcar that is running has anywhere near the projected ridership when it was proposed and its free light rail that runs with traffic just doesnt strike me as all that great of an investment
i dont get the bizarre aggressive crap that drivers in the dmv do either  the other day this dude almost hit me lurching into my lane then jumps back out of my lane passes the car in front of him then back into another lane then swerves back to the right then swerves to the left aggressively trying to pass everyone he thought he could pass  funny thing is this went on for over a mile the guy never got any farther ahead in traffic i never changed lanes and was still right there one car behind him  all that aggressive bs for nothing  youd think theyd wake up and realize it  part of me thinks they are just trying to pass just for the sake of passing given it accomplishes little  like just chill out dude
public transportation in my general area seems to suck       buses arent always running and when they do sometimes they dont even show up to the designated stop    im the biggest bike advocate and public transportation advocate there is but its been taking me too long to go where i need to go to the point where its not feasible anymorehttpsiibbcoxjhskkscreenshotmapsjpg
good point here
my taxes pay for better roads for my suvs
she truly is the worst i really wish someone good would have primaried her last year
investing in more pickle ball courts while short changing public transit
you are wrong source me homeless from  did not start the journey back till i got an apartment havent driven since 
might want to read up on how us interstate system was planned isolating poor neighborhoods was literally one of the goals  didnt have much to do with cars
deleted
cars often arent actually more convenient or faster though its just peoples default like the people who got stuck in traffic for hours trying to see the cherry blossoms last week its an extreme example but its super typical for just the day of pricing and time to be the same once you add in parking gas etc for the car
yes this is also part of the problem across both wards    there are only four fullservice grocery stores
the assholes on this sub who insist that everything can be done without a car probably a dont have kids and b can afford to live somewhere very close to a grocery store andor a metro stop its entitlement at its absolute worst
i think this is kind of where i fall on this issue as well for people that use a car simply for lack of other options it is a real shame and we should work towards providing better options for everyone else who needs to actually use a car of course they should be able to continue to do so safely and without judgement  it is pretty ridiculous that it is a  or  min drive to my parents house we are both in nw dc but if i were to take public transportation instead the wmata trip planner just quoted me  minutes and  busses that is just crazy not everyone lives on top of a metro station
i live near eastover it took me  minutes to get my son daycare on metro its a  minute drive in traffic and my son play football for anacostia park its no bus that take him to practice
yup i live a  minute walk from metro and my job is right in front metro but even still driving is  minutes and metro is  minutes
totally agree im not down with people driving on fake tags and paperwork   btw i respect your work i enjoy how you call out the trash in this city
yeah for some reason the narrative is now that we cant improve transit for poor people who just have to drive everywhere  maybe somewhere its true but definitely not across the dmv wards  just got a double whammy of being poor and less car dependent while the city made the neighborhoods more car dependent mostly to move regional traffic that shows up in crash records as well
you can just say nw its not like service is amazing in ne either
exactly when i rage against cars it is more about the altima with fake tags racing mph down the street or the lifted truck that cant see anything  if people drove safely cars wouldnt be as much of a problem
you dropped this  only levelheaded person on this subreddit    alot of these mfs on reddit here never been to where i stay at let alone across the river    alot of people shooting me dms telling me to buy a bicycle or an ebike    like bro i bike more than anybody on this subreddit its simply not sustainable everyday   i cant run and get groceries in the rain or do your everyday errandshttpsiibbcotwgtftscreenshotmapsjpg
this i have a car and love having a car but it sits all week public transit works for me when i need it thankfully but on the weekends its my escape pod im not really proud of it i guess but i know two people who have gotten cars because they enjoyed tagging along with me to places outside the city and realized how much they wanted that ability to escape i love this city but having a car doesnt mean im trying to ruin some cyclists day just because i like having one it give me a tons of freedom
yep you just described the primary reddit demographic to a t
tell me youve never lived in nyc lmao
yeah as i explain herehttpswwwredditcomrwashingtondccommentsrajaimnotsureifsomepeopleonthissubredditjepria cars are just super expensive when compared to either an ebike or public transportation
land is designed for cars and cars are our damn right it says that i the god book in one of the chapters kids can ride bikes at the playground thats what my tax doolers payed for    no one is forcing you to drive a car take the metro or learn how to ride a bike if you want to move around
another scenario you made up in your head
im not interested in driving let alone buying no vanilla ass kitchen appliance of a car lmao    keep that for you homie    you   a boring car for a  boring person match msde in heaven     if think a car a payment of  is equivalent to  rent payment in nw  this tells me all i need to know about you       youre not educated or sophisticated to hold a down a conversation with me
punitive only if youre doing so dangerously which is a major issue
when it comes to the ability to live without a car after nyc and boston im not sure any cities are ahead of dc in this country and yet this is  true even where you can live without a car it isnt always feasible last week i had to get from my home in hill east to my office in penn quarter back to hill east to pick up my kid for an emergency orthodontist appointment near farragut square and then back to hill east public transportation just wasnt an option that day
exactly not even se but the sentiment stands
unfortunately a lot of the urbanistobcessives just want to punish anyone from the suburbs for not living in the most expensive part of the city based on a perception that were all just white millionaires living on endless  acre tracts of mcmansions as far as the eye can see while they also live in the comfort of a life that would not be completely upended by their demands for a change before solutions method of development
its wild silver line goes all the way out to the middle of nowhere while the green line ends inside the beltway
lmao tell me a about it    lots of people dming me stupid shit even had someone tell me  how i should be ashamed of polluting the environment   lmao go fuck yourselfthese are the same motherfuckers touring the potomac in their marinas   i guanrtee my carbon foot printer is smaller then a toddlers foot print
guy who sold it to me told me its a reliable car from that year ill take his word for it over some random redditor     thanks for your input thoughyou sound like a certified hater so at least you got that going for you
oh yeah talk to the city  its not the city council council
im not even sure where or how to do that to begin with
i never want dc to be a car free city not everyone wants that my car is my safety i am for advocating for climate friendly advancements in vehicles and taking the license from dangerous drivers
the idea is we want dc to be a carfree citywespeak for yourself bro the mansplaining is some ish
all of se isnt ward  genius 
im just giving my perspective on why im no longer communicating via public transit as a se resident thats all
no thanks we dont want the density east of the river is in the city but still has an airy suburban feel
density isnt always the answer or the question public transit also comes down to politics and money and whowhere government wants connected and who gets excluded
definitely bring it
it really depends where youre going and there are also bicycle and scooter sharing services both of which can be taken on the metro you cant take your car on the metro
op clearly had their mind made up in the first place so its like why even post lol  like its super hilarious op complains about not having metro access where he lives but then wouldnt pay for the  anyways  httpsoldredditcomrwashingtondccommentsrajaimnotsureifsomepeopleonthissubredditjeoyyov
well said driving a car is no different than driving a weapon and with the way people handle themselves behind the wheel of a car in and around dc 
cruise ships alone and meat consumption alone produce more harm to the environment then car drivers but i dont see those things being condemned
yeah because  is expensive  i dont pay for the metro i think it should be free   my car doesnt put out alot of exhaust gasses which harm the environment    it a friendly v hp motor      also why should i care about an environment that doesnt care about me lmao
literally noone says that
ive posted this in this thread already but ill post it again  despite people hating on the sub hating our car dependent society is exactly what rfuckcars is about  httpswwwredditcomrfuckcarscommentshmytthoughtsithinkthisisanimportantideato   despite the name the subreddit is less about hating cars and more about hating the car dependent society weve created obviously most americans need cars but only because things are designed that way  httpswwwredditcomrfuckcarscommentsqtraeioftenhearonredditifwephaseoutcarsitshkoccvg   paratransit emergency services sure owning a subaru because you go hiking a couple times a year should be either car share or you store it outside the city  only the most extreme people would consider banning paratransit and emergency services what most want is far less usage of cars as a personal vehicle    similar to the people who cant imagine that shutting down critical arteries for yuppies to play in the street could possibly pose a serious problem for anybody  like literally no one says that
its a  year old mercedes im not sure its the flex they think it is
 year old amg they might want to get used to the public transportation system because im sure the ride will be in the shop quite a bit
yeah i think scooters are really dangerous and arent as safe as a bicycle
wait isnt he saying behind because you dont have eyes on the back of your head
poster boy of rfuckcars     it must be nice living near a metro station or having paved bike lanes to get you where you need to go  i guarantee you i ride more than you do
transit sucks and is unsafe for most citiesbut are we really to blame when the entire infrastructure is made so that public transport is not well maintained and unsafecan you provide a source to back up this claim i dont know of any evidence suggesting public transit in dc is less safe than commuting by car id be real curious to see some hard data comparing the two if you have any thanks
most of them have only been to one city in europe and spent no real time in the rest of the continent theyre tiresome
 transit sucks and is unsafe for most cities  im talking about the dc metro here since were in rwashingtondc  there were  assaults in  according to thishttpswwwwusacomarticlenewslocaldcassaultsonmetroskyrocketedinridershipplummeteddfecacbbedccb there were  million riders in  other than aggravated assault every other crime went down so out of all the people who ride metro its very unlikely statistically for you to be targeted  your lifetime chance of death by car is httpsinjuryfactsnscorgallinjuriespreventabledeathoverviewoddsofdying if you look at that link railway passenger was not calculable due to the low number of deaths  so in comparison a car is at least dozens of times more dangerous  besides if youre really that worried it isnt hard to keep mymtpds number to text on your phone and buy some pepper spray pepper spray hurts way more than anything else but it isnt lethal and permanently damaging so its more legal   also this applies to me as well   i take the metro daily and have for years  im no more disconnected from the reality of this city or its public transit system than you are
check out op post history for some ummm eye candy to go with your pop corn
youre assuming someone lives in close proximity to that station there are neighborhoods in congress that are a lengthy walk or bus ride from the stationand in their casesa car could be feesible same with anacostiagood hope  there are neighborhoods who are apart that area but no where close to being walking distance of metro
which is great except that urbanists always start with making it harder to drive and then shrug and say that transit improvements will naturally follow sometime maybestart with the transit improvements if you make transit good people will choose it
this guy bikes like  miles a week iirc from one of his posts before he got suspended for a week also op im glad you found friends and a community
i dont think those people want to make anyone do anything residents should have real alternatives which they currently do not have drivers should have to pay for their externalities like pollution and danger to pedestrians and dc shouldnt be bending over backwards to accommodate cars like providing incredibly undermarket city parking it takes a long time to walk anywhere in downtown dc because of having to wait at every crosswalk for traffic
bro just stop talking bro really hating on other grown ass men for putting down violence and getting a bag together lmao you probably from missouri or some shit
totally and the ban cars people definitely definitely support more metro i dont see how this is contradictory
yup gonna take it to my boys shop tomorrow we about to straight pipe that bitch and give it that raw v sound
lol they stay mad   these are the mfs that will call police on you for bbq and music
yea you buying
until it needs a repair and he realizes that costs more than he paid for the car in the first place
yup   idc what ppl think    this city is not bike friendly all the way to justify riding a bikemetro fulltime   this is coming from someone who used to bike miles a day
im not reading all that btw   bruh wrote a whole essay just to be wrong
hows transportation in brixtontower hamlets
on that note an ev charging station just opened up right across the dc line in coral hills shopping center this addition actually has me looking for the most reliable fiat the e
yeah like the problem here isnt people are bashing cats when actually they are good its that we have systematically and purposefully excluded se and forced its residents into something that is dangerous expensive bad for the planet in order to go about their daily life
thats exactly what goreweaver is saying youre just so eager to assume people are procar that you didnt actually read their post accurately
it is kind of funny how you totally missed the ops point and then went on your own tangent alls they are saying is before you go on another anticar rant consider that not everyone can rely on metro or other alternatives i have employees in congress heights if they lose access to their car they cant be at work no work no paycheck  metro isnt a good option the busses dont come near their home and uber wont work because of availability and pricing when folks on here start talking about raising parking rates or taxing cars that come into the city they rarely think of everyone in the service industry that has to drive to work because they cant live near their job
barring a successful adventure with a time machine this doesnt change the current situation for people living in the se
there were systematic reasons for thathttpswwwmappingsegregationdcorgmaps also why  and  are where they are
we design cities  thats the thing dc was never designed for or inteded to be what it is now yes residential but not a growing metropolis like the core of the issue is the huge influx of people but most would like to overlook that part of the issue because they are apart of the migration themselves everything was fine before you dumped more people in the mixnow were discussing cars and traffic patterns when the problem is really too many people they have been unsuccessful in fully redesigning the city to be the metropolis theyd like for it to be which is why there are soooo many issues from traffic to crime or packed hospitals and  minute ambulances maybeee just maybe dc wasnt designed for all thisat all
this the solution is not to let the rest of dc suck worse so that the car owners in se can have an easier time piloting dangerous machines we wouldnt accommodate this from nw people because their rich and we shouldnt do so for se people for the inverse either the problem is that se people think they need or depend on cars in the first place its tragic that they have to but the solution is not to embrace that
jfc get your head out of your own ass
se is going to be the next georgetown once the gentrification takes over
yup bikes and ebikes and scooters are a great solution especially since the weather isnt extreme but we have to put in protected bike lanes that drivers hate to make them a safer option
what if you have kids or need to carry shit with you
now imagine riding from southern ave se to georgetown via an ebike most people who live in se work outside their neighborhoodsgeorgetown to farrgut north is walkable but everything in this city is not walkable what happens to the line cook or the environmental staff that lives on branch ave se which is quite far from a metro station that works  georgetown as well likeebike is not an easy solution for them truth is most of the working class lives in the neighborhoods that arent walkableyet theyre the ones serving your coffee your lunch registering you at your appointments etcwhy make life harder for them by making the commute unbearablethese are the people that are being overlooked and its many folks not just a few most people of color and mostly natives
not to mention parking can be a real time suck or a significant expense in some places while bikescooter parking is very flexible
i think maybe you are being downvoted because owning an e bike is a bit expensive and your comment comes across as someone elitist    sure a car may be more expensive but a car can serve an entire family not just for a commute versus an ebike     generally people think of those owning a e bike similar to those owning a tesla      i am not saying that i do i dont just offering another perspective
this excludes people with mobility issues

do ebikes go in the same bike lanes that normal ones do or do you have treat yourself as a car i assume they go at least a little faster
you know a lot of people dont have the mobility to ride an ebike everywhere right and in bad weather or of you have kids theyre almost a nonstarter so youre being downvoted for blithely spouting off about ebikes when they dont address half the stuff in ops posteta the other issue with trying to rely exclusively on ebikes is that a lot of folks dont have the luxury of bringing it into their workplace or have a bike room please tell me how a grocery worker line cook waitress construction worker or other nonwhite collar workers are supposed  to secure their ebike without risk of theft while they work their shiftyour elitism is why youre getting downvoted
right and every time the city tries to make the most mild design improvements to reduce car dependence  like the connecticut ave protected bike lanes  a bunch of upper northwest and suburban nimbys come in and cry and complain about it further reinforcing car dependence
im on rfuckcars and my experience there  of the time is explicitly antithetical to the rest of reddits opinion of itmeanwhile i have people from this thread denying that roads get widened and things get torn down for car infrastructure and stalking me across subs to scream propaganda at me
the sidebar says that but in practice its very much geared towards raging hate against cars in just about any context  calling people carbrains or other such derogatory terms is pretty rampant  its not a civil place
people slash tires and key cars and rationalize it on that sub
i prefer rnotjustbikes instead also another really good subreddit
they also tell you to move which is dumb
given almost anyone living in chevy chaseforest hills could chose to move anywhere else in the city this is not at all the samethey also have additional rush hour bus service down connecticut and dedicated frequent lines down western and military to move people eastwestbut you do make a good case to build the protected bike lanes down connecticut cheers
tenleytown is nw dc and one of the most expensive neighborhoods
its actually got pretty decent ridership would be  better though if it would a ram cars instead of wait for someone to move them when a car is blocking it and b could control lights to ensure minimal stoppage
 i dont get the bizarre aggressive crap that drivers in the dmv do either   when theres no enforcement theres literally no reason to not act like an asshole assuming your car doesnt get damaged
drugs
this is the situation for most life eotr is in no way convenient having a car helps a bunch
most are with you thanks for the post
most agree with you the wacky car hating activists you see on here are a niche vocal minority
have you thought about an ebike if you look at my travel insightshttpsimgurcomauexmgyy car is barely faster its like  mihr vs  mihr sometimes its been  mihr but you should keep in mind youre paying a huge premium for that and given the layout of dc i dont really think cars are very optimal
not to argue your point because i agree but according to the hours you spent roughly  days in a form of transit in the  day month of march
that sounds like quite a journey im not saying that cars are the best means of reliable transportation but a means especially if you live in an area far from job opportunities with poor transit the best means would probably be walking
hard agree about isolating poor neighborhoods but idk about the cars the interstate system was designed in part to allow white flight suburbanites to get in and out of the city everyday
well new york city exists but youre right that is true everywhere else
cars are only faster if youre going to and from someplace convenient to a major arterial such as  or rock creek parkway i took metro from east falls church to brookland yesterday and it was about  minutes door to door driving would have been at best five minutes faster but significantly more expensive and less comfortable
people never seem to account for the hidden costs of cars either  sure theres the obvious cost of gas but theres a reason the irs sets a reimbursement rate of  cents a mile  driving a car is expensive when you factor in wear and tear and insurance registration etc take the op  it could actually cost him more to drive those  miles than take public transportation

 cars often arent actually more convenient or faster thoughfor people like you who live in an apartment next to a metro stop
yes and taking gallons of milk or laundry detergent on the bus while pushing a kid in a  stroller is awful
yeah often feel that theyre not wrong about their complaints eg people shouldnt park in the bike lane but they are willfully ignorant about where our limited resources should be going they truly believe that many longtime residents and native washingtonians just hate bike lanes for no rational reason when most of the time their argument is pretty simple that they want other stuff first
its not entitlement to push against carcentric infrastructure so that everyone can have those things it doesnt have to be this way
its not entitlement to push against carcentric infrastructure so that everyone can have those things it doesnt have to be this way
 min by car for me im right off  vs  by transit  its a no brainer
oh i didnt realize you were op yeah ive noticed youve had my back thanks for the supportyeah its your right to have a car so you do you
i mean yeah nw definitely had the best access but i think you could definitely argue ne is still much much better than se or sw
one of the main reasons i kept my car when i moved here was my cat just last week i had to bring him to the emergency vet i was there from  pm to  am and its a minute drive from my apartment times i accomplish my errands commute etc by foot or by bike and i absolutely love it my car often goes untouched for two or three weeks at a time but when i need to take the cat to the vet at  pm man im so glad i have it
yup when i used to metro to work i only put like k miles a year on my car it was kind of a waste but such a convenience as an adult i kind of feel i should have one
you are correct the goal here shouldnt be to not have cars it should be to design a city where you drive less there is a huge societal and personal benefit if you drive k miles a year instead of the national average of k
dude not everyone wants to ride a fucking bike
the issue is that everyone else who doesnt drive is subsidizing car drivers  httpswwwstrongtownsorgjournalpayyourfairshare    car   bike   person walking 
i will take it that your comment was intended in a lighthearted way i do ride my bike but only for leisure the places i go for workerrands require me to travel down dangerous roads with drivers traveling at high speeds where there is no shoulder i have yet to work up to courage or find a practical way around these roads that would allow me to make any of these trips by bikei see a ton of people in my area route  corridor in pg county walking or riding the bus as you stated it really sucks to not to have a car because while the trips are possible its a real hassle there are trains in college parknew carrollton but kind of useless unless youre headed into the cityi think i basically agree with you in that i dont think cars are better but having a car when all the other options suck is clearly better
this reply eliminated your ability to credibly say that car ownership was fiscally responsible for the poor its not the payment its the payment plus the upkeep plus insurance taxes etc etc so yeah it is dumb its also an unfortunate cycle that ensures the poor stay poor cars have almost  roi its money going straight in the trash we just finished layoff our shitbox and we wont replace it until it dies the money were saving is maxing my roth we moved closer to metro and dont drive the thing savings in fuel tires etc are all going to vacation cars are necessary but still evil linking selfworth to car ownership is just some wierd toxic masculinity shit that lets people like trayon white get away with crap policy decisions
not quite what im talking about talking more about measures that just result in making driving inconvenient taking away lanes closing off entire streets taking away parking increasing the cost of parkingcar registration fees all these ideas are too make driving a car such an expensive painful experience that metro becomes a comparable option
i think thats a good bit of hyperbole dont you most urbanists see a city like dc and see a city that was built around walking and transit and should really be more convenient for that the problem isnt people living in adelphi or pg county oftentimes the people who are advocating for fewer bike lanes road expansions and for dc to be overhauled in favor of cars are people from bethesda fairfax the most expensive suburbs around because they have the time and money to make that their pet cause and the lack of perspective to think that them saving  minutes of commuting is worth disrupting the flow of a city there are many many examples throughout the world of walkable and transit friendly cities that are still commuter friendly the reason why were not is because more often than not the strongest forces behind urban design policies arent middle class suburban or urban folks its people who have a ton of money and dont give a crap about making cities more convenient for anybody but them
yeah the only area with public transportation is the most expensive part of the city lol the lies people like you tell yourself to justify your own choices are amazing
i live in a sfh in a more rural area and i commute  miles by ebike we do have a bus that runs here but it only runs in the morning and the afternoonevening and stops running at  pm from the metro station  everyone else here just owns a car and i wish we had better public transportation everywhere and dedicated bus lanes

nah they want to provide alternatives to cars  everywhere
silver line only goes as far as it does because of iad really  its kind of a funny thing that people argue that md doesnt build a bridge over the potomac because they want people to go to bwi yet now the dc metro goes to iad making iad more convenient than bwi if you take public transit
yuppies shaming people for using their vehicles to commute to work so cringe
not a hater just reminding you that an k car requires a lot of maintenance regardless of its current value i hope it works out for you but generally speaking a very low number of those older mercedes are still on the road compared to a corolla of that year
literally tell them you want to be less car dependent tell them to bring back the things they promised to wards  but have yet to work towards thats the anacostia streetcar but also the benning road extension and expanded circulator service make it respectful and brief but if you just email them theyll acknowledge and probably even reach out you might be surprised how accessible a council member can be start with white but the at large members will pay attention as well
its almost as if you didnt read what they said   the idea is we want dc to be a carfree city that doesnt mean just banning cars and forcing people to deal with what they have it means changing the hard infrastructure so that its easy to live without a car everywhere including senoneighborhood is saying to make it easier for people to not need to drive everywhere including se dc for one thing cars are expensive so its basically a tax on the poor to force people to have to drive to get to work
they are speaking from the anticar perspective not everyone
so you speak for all women thats a healthy mindset 
i assume the op this person is responding to is a man based on their user name lol
okay thats understandable thats exactly what people are complaining about that you need a car to get anywhere because there arent many other options and those that exist are inadequate and need improvement it seems like everyone is on the same page to me
deleted
still those areas arent very dense could deal with a bit more along with public transit investments theres so much suburban sprawl in our country lets eliminate that from dc
lmao no its not   you made this scenario up in your head  
thats not true cruise ships produce much less very harmful air pollution than cars do in aggregate i havent seen an accounting of meat consumption v air pollution from cars but yeah people should probably be eating less meat
hilarious comment like you somehow live in a different planet from you car
great attitude man your car definitely does put out a lot of exhaust which affects peoples cognitive ability among other things the metro doesnt cost  but even if it did the metro would be much cheaper than owning and maintaining your mercedesbenz im not really sympathetic
would you take it if it was free or subsidized by your employer
how many times are you going to bring up your  year old car in this post
even if you bought the unlimited  pass for the  price point that would still be cheaper than the month youre paying for your car not to mention your car also has maintenance costs youre not factoring in and youre probably going to have to buy a new car eventually  by my calculations largo to iad would cost  in gas with  mpg and thats not factoring other costs like insurance and maintenance and oh parking too parking at iad is extremely expensive and driving from largo to dulles isnt even faster  httpswwwwashingtonpostcomtransportationdullesfastestdrivingsilverline  httpsarchivephuqv  i think it should be free  hard disagree a thief who steals wallets on the metro definitely doesnt care about paying for the fare so with the new faregates it helps keep those who commit crime out could it be lower perhaps but funding needs to come from somewhere but having a fare is a safety feature   also why should i care about an environment that doesnt care about me lmao  why should i care about other peoples health and not put out exhaust fumes that affect their lungs and their cognitive function man you sound pretty selfish
are you kidding people say that in this sub all the time
umm did they not shut down h street once a month for this to take place like a sunday a month h street was no cars over the summer or something like thata main artery of this city a street that literally leads out the city and should honestly never be closed in case of emergency there are certain streets like h and pennsylvania ave where if you ride it straight it takes you out the city and have special street signs for this reason if you pay attentionnot sure if hes referring to this exactly but the shoe surely fits
theres an entire sub dedicated to it and a blog called ggw
like literally no one says thatlike literally every time the city shuts down critical streets for open streets or a marathon people say that
old mercs are cooler than the new ones though
but its a luxury car

i dont care to be politically correct so here i go there are many homeless people who live in the train stations i have seen three physical assaults myself where they try to get aggressive towards an individual do you genuinely feel like a woman can travel safely in our metro during nights  just shows how disconnected you are from this city yea show me more wikipedia articles of how cars collide and trains dont what a waste of time you are

anacostia barry farms and congress heights are highly walkable i spent yrs working in barry farms while living in se capitol i walked when the weather was nice and took metro when it was bad i am very familiar with walking that area and the infrastructure has been greatly improved in the past several months the negatives might be that there are some hills east if pennsylvania is where the city needs to invest in better infrastructure
i agree and as an urbanist dont believe that transit improvements will naturally follow imo it should be the other way around first getting people used to carless areas the area around high or main streets for example should be partially converted then fully converted next the city should make it more appealing for people to use transit instead of driving increasing access and financial incentives ie free transit for certain areasfinally disincentive for car owners  city tax more expensive parking and reduced incity gas stations
huh
how do you pay for danger  its inherently potential if a driver hits someone they should absolutely pay for that your comment about walking in downtown dc isnt what op was talking about they were pointing out that the entire city is not equally accessible to transit so some ppl need cars im all for walking and transit when they are real options but dcs metro system is a stupid hub and spoke model that leaves large pockets out of the equation
karens gonna karen they vote for bernie and think theyre not racists and uphold one of the most openly racist countries in w europe the netherlands as a model the dutch built transit deprived ghettos into the present and then yell at folks have to walk miles to the nearest transit stop i never ever need opinions about anything from the dutch
how much that car set you back
time has cost too waiting hours in a week for a bus that doesnt come is a cost too
i have two suvs and theres nothing like going to le dip and just leaving you car with the valet eat dinner and get inside you vehicle and drive home while you see people waiting for their shared rides
if you would think about how much you telling me the fuck outa here when what was written was certainly not in any way trying to say anything was wrong wyou as a person but that much vitriol is the very first thing i get how much does that help i feel slightly bad in a way i cannot really understand and you have just said this for the folks that want hate dont have to get it we dont have to give them this

i live in nw dc near columbia heights with family so i really dont have rent costs however i work at dca its almost impossible for me to take the train to work in the morning since the yellow line closed and i have to be there at  am so now im paying  a morning to get to work and paying for the metro to get home on the mornings where i dont have the money to get all the way there i uber to mcpherson square and take the train the rest of the way this is the closest ive ever come to buying a car since i moved to dc
literally the same ppl serving the privileged their lattes and sweetgreen rely on cars lets ban cars and see how the economy of downtown crumbles due to the tardiness and absences of the service employees who keep shit running
well said
cars are a horribly unreliable alternative if youre on a tight income ive lived in places that are truly public transportation deserts with no other options however slow when your car breaks or you get in an accident you arent just an hour late to your shift because the bus takes a bit longer youre totally fucked maybe you can walk but its probably along a highway maybe you can get a payday loan or something to pay for the repair but maybe youre out of a way to get around for weeks its incredibly precarious we have to invest in alternatives rather than hooking poor people into car ownership and saying thats good enoughcars are only this reliable freedom machine for well off people anyone actually living paycheck to paycheck knows theyre a double edged sword at best
similarly making procar choices today will not help se or dmv be in a better place in the future
you dont need a time machine to improve public transportation dedicated bus lanes frequent service better reliability are totally doable and fix the problems op identified without huge construction costs and disruption to routes
there are tons of examples of cities on the east coast that were not designed for cars because they didnt exist yet
yup  agree with this the problem is whenever there are bike lanes created drivers always complain about them
not the op but just giving my  cents  uhambone  what if you have kids  there are cargo bike momshttpswwwtheatlanticcomtechnologyarchivecargobikemomsaregentrifyingthenetherlands in the netherlands now to be fair the netherlands has a lot better bike infrastructure but it shows its sure as heck possible   also it is possible to install a child seat on certain ebikeshttpswwwebikingtodaycomcanyouputachildseatonanelectricbike  a third option is a child trailer obviously good bike infrastructure is necessary but again the possibility is there   need to carry shit with you  panniers on a rear rack can carry quite a bit you can also have a basket in the front on many ebikes  but for bigger hauls there are cargo trailers that can be attached to the rear wheel  httpselectricbikereportcomguidetoelectricbiketrailers  i cant find the post right now but i remember someone lugging a lot on his ebike like even  packs of la croix  like you know before cars horses existed and we did just fine with them  also just fyi a lot of people in nyc have carts they bring with them when shopping they just make more frequent trips like in europe a car isnt the only way to do grocery shopping people are just used to that as the default  the downvotes just prove that people feel any sort of change is an attack on their lifestyle and way of life i can imagine people saying how dare you but im right before cars horses existed and people did fine with horses you dont need cars to carry kids or luggage
take a walk around capitol hill or any other bike friendly neighborhood and youll see loads of long tail ebikes with child seats on the back also heres the great thing about bikes when the kids get old enough they can actually ride their own bike eventually they can even do it without youto carry stuff you can either specifically get a cargo bike or use a bike trailer like i do for really big grocery trips or large purchases if its a really big thing that truly cant fit in either of those and you cant get it delivered then you can rent a car for that specific trip unless you are moving couches weekly most people will come out ahead renting a car for those occasions rather than owning a truck for that off chance haul
i can carry a weeks worth of groceries for my family on the back of my radwagon
i love how everyone just dodged this question
and people with disabilities
 branch ave se which is quite far from a metro station that works  georgetown as well likeebike is not an easy solution for them  looks fine to me i did a glance using google maps street view and looked fine  httpsiimgurcomdljipng  i should note that google maps is actually quite crappy for planning out bike rides and that komoot is a lot better for this also that  minutes is via conventional bicycle so an ebike would be faster  also even if there werent a sidewalk generally neighborhood streets are limited to  mph and class  ebikes can reach up to  mph with the motor
yup its often tough to find parking and parking can be expensive i remember when my dad would drive us to dc to get haircuts hed spend a ton of time driving in circles to find parking on the street
 i think maybe you are being downvoted because owning an e bike is a bit expensive  this is super funny to me because owning a car isnt this is exactly what people mean when they talk about motornomativityhttpswwwredditcomrnotjustbikescommentsfziikmotornomativityafancywordforcarbrainstudy considering i have to post all these figures for people to realize how much theyre paying for a car  my dad spends k on gas alonehttpsiimgurcombwrxrwzpng my dad spends month on insurance  the average american spends  on gas per month the average cost of full coverage is  per month thats month going down the drain each month when that would be month with an ebike well the charging cost is not  exactly but ive calculated and if i charged  everyday for a year for  wh that would be like  thats not to mention the cost of maintenance i remember maintenance for my dads  jeep patriot cost over k at one point  if we are talking about money owning a car is  more expensive than owning an ebike so its not elitist at all if we want to help people spend less money and also help the environment we should  be encouraging ebikes and escooters and public transportation
actually there are a lot of disabled people and veterans who are helped by ebikes  httpsoutriderusacompageselectricbikesfordisabled  httpswwwlegionorgoperationcomfortwarriorsnewbikehelpsdisabledveteranexerciseenjoyoutdoors  httpslbpostcomlongbeachizeaddisonpropelbikesdisabledcombatveterandtlb  but even that being the case i think it should be obvious that being against carcentric infrastructure doesnt mean being against paratransit
i ride my ebike in the same bike lanes that normal ones do ive never had any issue with it also technically really fit riders can reach ebike speeds   i assume they go at least a little faster  yup when theres no traffic at  pm   am i average around    mph although i still have room to improve in terms of power but i also have a lot of hills on my route  this is a thread that talks about google map estimates  httpswwwredditcomrebikescommentshbvsebikesandcommutingwithgooglemapsestimates
come on man they were just giving a suggestion not as a onesizefitsall solution for every single person no need to be hecking rude about it id argue your comment should be downvoted just for rudeness alone they even say in another comment how they arent against paratransit for disabled people  httpswwwredditcomrwashingtondccommentsrajaimnotsureifsomepeopleonthissubredditjepwxb
they had a suggestion they didnt say it was a one size fits all solution no need to be rude about it
 calling people carbrains or other such derogatory terms is pretty rampant its not a civil place  the technical term is motornomativity but its been proven to be actually true  httpswwwredditcomrnotjustbikescommentsfziikmotornomativityafancywordforcarbrainstudy  so sure maybe people could be more polite but id argue when the us is so extreme in its cardependence being somewhat extremist in the other direction is somewhat of a necessity
not the majority of highly upvoted posts obviously every big community has extreme weirdos
yes i used to live there before i bought my house is very safe clean and quiet
no other reason there are quite possibly an infinite number of reasons not to drive like an asshole that arent simply to avoid law enforcement but yes for those that do need that check its not there
very good point particularly if your car doesnt cost much to begin with
id argue the car worship activists are worseexpand public transit to serve people better fuck that moar lanes nao make the highway the width of the city

yeah i actually used to live in a more car dependent city on a very tight budget a car was completely out of reach  insurancegasrepairs wouldve been like month and that wasnt even including buying the car itself
yeah i detail some of the costs herehttpsoldredditcomrwashingtondccommentsrajaimnotsureifsomepeopleonthissubredditjepria and what my dad spends on his car its so much money per month going down the drain when other forms of transportation public transportation ebike escooter etc are much cheaper
im glad you agree we need more dedicated bus lanes in the meantime may i introduce a magic little thing called the metro to you you go underground under all the traffic not stuck in it
hey im glad you agree we need dedicated bus lanes   but in many cases like seeing the cherry blossoms last week an ebike can be much faster but everyones default is simply to drive a car heck for the cherry blossoms a regular bicycle probably wouldve been faster especially considering you can take bikes on the metro
to meits what the cars represent we do not need cars but we need social interaction we need to not waste resources we need to back away from the tablenot double down

that last part change isnt going to happen if its only incremental and piecemeal often times its just not safe or economical to bike eotr and these are also residents whove been asking the city for a number of things higher on the priority list and have yet to receive them
uh no se west of anacostia has considerable access to metrorail and bus connections sw is so small it probably has a very high ratio comparatively se eotr id agree ne though its just the red line and a bit of the blueorangesilver
if you can afford ones and parking isnt a nightmare i always encourage people to as you probably already know there is so much awesome stuff around the area that its totally worth having one
no need to be so rude to anyone and honestly no offense but looking at your post history on this thread you seem like a pretty rude person despite the problems cars cause if people want to drive fine but people should also admit how much cars actually cost its like at least month for gas and insurance alone  a lot of us are arguing for bicycles and public transportation because those are the cheaper options  like if your car breaks down or gets into an accident thats a big problem if you take taxi or uber its going to be pretty expensive which is even worse for a poor person i think being able to drive a car and weather those expenses is showing a lot of privilege to be honest  the fact that this got downvoted shows that people dont actually care about poor people but they just want to drive cars my point is proven id argue itd be better if we stuck with horses considering horses would probably be cheaper than cars  this sub is so weird sometimes considering the that comments about the hidden costs of cars got upvoted herehttpswwwredditcomrwashingtondccommentsrajaimnotsureifsomepeopleonthissubredditjepehkcontext   insurancegasrepairs wouldve been like month and that wasnt even including buying the car itself

yep and many complain about delivery drivers while their ability to exist carfree heavily depends on having things delivered to their residence we all need to be more understanding
no its to remove subsided life style choices    its not a punishment to make someone pay the actual cost of something instead of it being free
the issue is that behind those super expensive suburbs are more low and middle income communities people here post just frankly moronic posts that are as short sighted and stupid as the bethesda millionaires who want everything to be highways like big picture we probably agree on an ideal dc transportation approach if we had a blank slate and my post was intentionally hyperbolic but the fact is i regularly see posts here that are clearly written by people who a have never gone past bethesdadtss or anywhere in pg and who b just outright reject that the suburbs arent a blank slate or completely homogenous by county people here will demand that their access to a luxury apartment in the suburbs next to a metro station is more important than thousands of middle and working class people being able to use the metro which is just as short sighted
i have definitely been yelled at multiple times in this sub for saying that i drive a car to work its not the majority opinion but there is a subset of urbanists who are primarily motivated by the opinion that they personally should not have to be bothered by cars as they walk from their centrally located apartment to the grocery store even if it means the rest of the city becomes inaccessible to  of the regions population
most people who move to the city by choice arent buying homes further east than stadium armory or further southeast than navy yard that means that proximity to heavy rail is usually a luxury were not selling our home anytime soon but if we did id be sure we advertise walkability to metrorail
even if there were better public transportation there are some instances where a car is more convenient i am an immigrant and when i just moved here i use to work two jobs  pm and my partime from pm to pm while i could take the bus home at night it would have taken me  minutes to get home vs  minutes by car and  minutes in the morning vs  hour the bus was way cheaper however when you are tired those minutes add up when you get little sleep to survive financially
i think youre confused about my post im not advocating that all of dc should be turned into la im saying that where public transit infrastructure is lacking we shouldnt take cars out of the equation without an actual solution to how all of those people in cars will get around maybe try not to assume bad faith on the part of everyone else
theres always someone in this group ready to pick a fight i said my car is my safety public transportation isnt for everyone its a difference of opinion shared on a social platform
he is absolutely trying to speak for everyone he does it constantly
hating is strong in this one
my commute on the metro is  dollars each day i go into the office and thats if i drive to the closer metro station if i go to the one thats bus accessible its  plus the partial price of taking an express bus im sure if you live downtown its more affordable but many of us dont live downtown
isnt the cheapest metro ride  so isnt  a day reasonable to say that would be the cost for public transportation
sounds like youre upset about something  hope you have that same energy where you can give that lecture  youre giving to me to diesel bus drivers or  wheelers
lol so salty 
ok link an example if its so common
maybe we should expand h st to  lanes so if theres an emergency everyone can escape
show me where ggw says ban all cars
im not against public transportation my entire life is spent on it but its just not practical to get me where i need to go   you try waiting for a busmetro that doesnt come or is extremely late stop assuming stuff   you keep talking about reality so im giving you mine
i take the metro daily and have for years  im no more disconnected from the reality of this city or its public transit system than you are you are just fearmongering and i dont give a shit about how politically correct you are i just wanted to know if you could actually back up your assertions with anything more than useless anecdotes you cant talk about a waste of time
honestly the perfect response when confronted with factual information you just rant about how youre not politically correct and you dont care what the evidence says perfect encapsulation of a certain type of person
lol theyre making a claim that public transit is unsafe im asking them to back that up with actual evidence since its well established that passenger vehicles are by far the most dangerous of different mode of transportation when compared in the ushttpsinjuryfactsnscorghomeandcommunitysafetytopicsdeathsbytransportationmodetextpassengervehiclesarebyfarhigherthanforscheduledairlinesso yeah sorry that id like someone to provide any sort of evidence to back their completely bullshit madeup claim nice contribution to the discussion though real bigbrain stuff there
soo living in halley house on south capitol is walkable there is no metro for milesand there are dozens of neighborhoods in that area that are alsono where near the metroor what if you live up near bread of the city towards stanton roadthat is in no way walkable yet the closest station is indeed anacostiaand the only way to get to the station would be via bushills are an understatement well theres no other way to name them but those are some steep ass hills going up towards stanton rd lower goodhope mlk ave all the way up to ballou and a few blocks in between are considered walkable but there are more neighborhoods that exist outside that perimeter than there are within the permiter
how do you pay for danger its inherently potential if a driver hits someone they should absolutely pay for thatby making it more expensive and less attractive to drive many people think driving is as simple as i get in my car and go to my destination and are totally oblivious to the externalities related to their decision such as land use and environmental concerns youre not the only person impacted by your decision to get in a car and drive
car literally cost me k  there is no setback

looks fine to me  your problem you dont guage comfort for others i didnt mind biking to work from navy yard to the national mall because it made sense for mebut id never feel comfortable riding anything other than a car from se dc to georgetown because to me  that looks like a hell no respectfully anddd i have a right to say that i mean i have a  year old toddler imagine if they go to school in ivy city and i work in georgetown but live on branch ave now draw me a map for that and tell me how i should be comfy motorbiking my kid and  bags all over town oh yea slide in my pharmacy on benning rd if i gotta pick up my dads medicine and he lives on south capitol so i gotta drop it there as well like i need a damn car lol the arrogance and audacity of some of yall unintentional or not its very audacious not every person has the choice for a biking alternativelike seriously
i guess you did not read my comment   yes owning a car is expensive and if you are a single person it is certainly overall the more expensive choice  but if you are a family owning a car is frequently more economical  particularly if two adult family member share it   if you are in an area that is inaccessible to public transit try getting the kids to school on an ebike     or getting a weeks worth of groceries for a family particularly in an area which is a food desert  how about getting a sick kid to the doctors     if you are a struggling family i dont think your choice is going to be an ebike
man it sucks that youre getting downvoted for stating the truth that it wasnt a onesizefitsall solution
sorry im not sure what was rude about explaining why they were being downvoted theyve since edited their comment but at one point they had something in there about not understanding the downvotesand it is elitist to lecture about ebikes without any real acknowledgement that they might not work for some people whether due to health or not having secure storage for it etc ebikes can be a great alternative in some cases and for some people but not for everyone
sorry this doesnt track  the term carbrain is liberally applied there to anyone who uses a car for any reason regardless of whether or not they would like accessible public transit for everyone and if they take public transit when available as a lot of car owners do myself included  the presence of a social bias doesnt excuse the derogatory use of slurs towards people who exist in such a societyi also find a great amount of irony in the people who use private car owners for things like uber and getting groceries delivered but also want to ban themextremism is not the answer to extremism  sense is
well my point is if youre an asshole already theres no reason to not act like an asshole drivers cyclists or pedestrians theres always going to be assholes
i dont know if its wacky to not want to be killed by a car
the difference is this is a figment of your imagination  meanwhile people who unironically post to a sub called fuckcars are all over this sub
i agree

honestly even on bike it was difficult to navigate the crowds the idea of driving down there seemed like a nightmare
you fucking hear yourself youre basically telling someone they shouldnt have had kids so they could rely on public transportation get outta here
sure but youre describing the ideal end state what op is talking about is the way things are now some people have multiple grocery stores within a quick walk and many others have to decide whether to spend an hour plus on the bus or drive for ten minutes same situation with schools work church etc
not disagreeing that its difficult to do both however to be fair having a kid is somewhat of a choice its perfectly a fine choice to be childfree  if you have to shop while carrying the baby yourself on public transit that means you couldnt hire a babysitter so finances do come into question  if its wrong to believe that you should have a certain income level to become a parent then so be it but im pretty sure adoption agencies have those sorts of checks to them   youre basically telling someone they shouldnt have had kids so they could rely on public transportation   im saying that having a child is pretty much the biggest way to increase your carbon footprint its not just about public transportation increasing carbon footprint in general is bad for the planet  and either way if you want to have kids its bad to raise kids in a place where they cant have freedom and independence why we wont raise kids in suburbiahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohlpmxltxpw like can any of you say that your kids have a better experience than whats shown in that video nyc is probably the single place thats comparable   you know you have a crappy cardependent life and you might even be poor which are a lot of people are claiming in this thread and you bring a kid into that its just not cool  i grew up poor and i suffered a lot because of that i didnt get to participate in other things people did like trading pokemon cards because we were poor and i knew i had handmedown clothes from my older brother i remember i never attended any afterschool events in elementary school even mandatory ones because my mom never drove me there if the distance was shorter i probably would have just walked there myself as a kid  this was a long rant but the tldr is if youre going to have kids you should provide the best experiences for them and raising them in cardependent suburbia is not providing the best experience for them  i can say i would have rather lived in a walkable area of nyc as a kid rather than suburbia where you must have a car honestly back when i was growing up the rideon bus coverage was quite poor and its come a long way since then    keep downvoting folks it wont change the facts that youre providing a subpar experience for your kids
well yeah if youre just talking straight metro rail but at least from my experiences the vast majority of the parts of ne that ive needed to get to that werent all that accessible by metrorail were accessible by bus but then of course you then get into what op was saying about transit times
how is driving a car that you saved up for  sweating blood and tears a privilege
because i dont want to ride a bike and the fact that ride a bike is a common retort on this sub when it comes to public transit issues is fucking annoying why dont you just accept that not everyone wants to ride a fucking bike
i dont even get why some deliveries are made by drivers a few weeks ago i had covid so i stayed home and ordered in all of the deliveries were made by cars even from restaurants that were less than  blocks away
oh so youd be fine if people who bike were responsible for funding bike lanes i guess people with dogs should also pay up for dog parks

i think their point was that he wasnt arguing for forcing you or anyone to use public transportation only to make it easier for everyone else whos okay with using public transportation to have that option  if you actively fight against giving people the option to use public transportation youre fighting for a worse planet earth
yep got me there you got a big car everyone here is wishing they could be like you i would  honestly say you are nothing short of a  hero
okay that is still much cheaper than owning and using a car and if dc had congestion pricing that money could be put toward the metro making it cheaper and better
even if thats true  a day is much much cheaper than owning and using a car
 on the weekends and late evenings
im not mad about anything but it seems youre more interested in bragging about your car than like talking about transit policy

pretty much their whole thing people whiter than cotton mather blabbing about being the new amsterdam
holy shit this has got to be the most retarded thing ive seen in a minute when they say public transit is unsafe they are talking about assaults robberies and harassments not fucking bus and train accidents
soo living in halley houseis that where you live or did you just randomly search a place halley house is about a  minute walk to congress heights metro separately cars arent the only mode of transportation besides walking ebikes are cheaper than cars halley house to the metro on an ebike would be  mins and less expensive than owning a car and driving
more expensive to drive is covered in auto insurance already get caught without it and the fines are pretty big plus youre still on the hook for whatever damages you caused even with it hit a pedestrian and rates go up quite a biti dont disagree with your principle i just think its already being implemented if its a discussion about how much and you want to increase those penalties im personally ok with that but i make enough to cover an across the board increase with minimal impact to my purchasing power  but a lot of others are barely making it now
good value but there are other costs as well insurance maintenance gas etc probably would have been cheaper to stick with uber and bikingpublic transport ultimately its your choice but you dont have to act like a martyr about it
whats your problem bro
well unless youre a bird the rats are on their own
indoor cats
no one is saying people cant own cars people will always own cars in dc the government doesnt need to avoid things that help noncar transport building bike lanes dedicated bus lanes increases to parking fees etc to help out car owners though
exactly and i live in navy yard rn but i was born and raised in se so i know exactly what theyre going through
deleted
you literally can create space its called up zoning   dc is no where near the densest city in earth
 the people is is whats continuously being overlooked because nobody wants to admit their moving here is apart of the problem  no the cars and carcentric infrastructure are the problem nyc has a density of k peoplemi  dc has k peoplemi  yet nyc has no problems with that many people if dc had better public transportation and more dedicated bus lanes this wouldnt be an issue  even in places like the agricultural reserve where theres a lot of space people just drive because public transportation options arent very good space is definitely not the problem there
imagine if the city didnt accommodate for all of my choices like come on you are choosing to spread yourself around the city at some point or just choosing the most egregious examples
the point is that your thinking comes from a carcentric point of view if we lived in communities where it was safer to walk and bike bikes suddenly become for everyone

i mean theres also rnotjustbikes if you want another subreddit thats more polite the guy literally moved to the netherlands just because of how bad car dependency was in the us and to provide a good experience for his kids  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohlpmxltxpw  however notjustbikes focuses on europe since hes given up on the us i also find a great amount of irony in the people who use private car owners for things like uber and getting groceries delivered but also want to ban themi generally try to limit my ride sharing as much as possible and im hoping to get my car usage to  starting next month i cant speak for other people   extremism is not the answer to extremism sense islets just agree to disagree on this considering moderate solutions wont help save the planet
this thread is a really important read about what rfuckcars is actually about  httpswwwredditcomrfuckcarscommentshmytthoughtsithinkthisisanimportantideato   despite the name the subreddit is less about hating cars and more about hating the car dependent society weve created obviously most americans need cars but only because things are designed that way  httpswwwredditcomrnotjustbikescommentszxurthisisnotrfuckcarsjznsiy   yeah there is absolutely overlap between the two subs and that makes sense because well fuck cars amirite although i do drive sometimes i also acknowledge that cars are the source of a lot of problems in our cities        one of the things i find difficult is communicating with americans because the us is so wildly extreme in its cardependence that its hard to have an intelligent conversation about it if im talking to say a german person about reducing carusage i can make some very reasonable propositions that would be considered mindbogglingly extreme in the us my recent video about amsterdam removing parking spaces is a good example i mostly documented actual policies being implemented by a democraticallyelected government but when it hit the youtube algorithm in america and was posted to americancentric forums like reddit youd think i proposed murdering everyones dog and forcing them to march to the gulags and to be totally blunt i want to continue to talk about these issues in a european context because us urbanism is a dumpster fire and i dont want european cities sitting on their laurels just because theyre so much better than the worlds worst example i understand that there are a lot of advocates out there trying to change us cities for the better and i appreciate them and their work but i personally have given up on us cities i dont really have an interest in talking about the us except as a warning to europeans who see the suburbs in movies and have a nave view of what theyre actually like
its literally fucking not though roads get expanded all the time people fight for more lanes all the time and tear shit down for more car infrastructure all the timeyour complete denial of these basic facts of reality while arguing for car infrastructure and against public transit is proof that youre the extremist denying basic facts to defend your worship of petrolmeanwhile hey what if we expand bus service is wacky activistsgtfoh and go suck on a tailpipe edit oh yeaaaa ride that block button daddy show the world you have no retortedit javons paradox for the grumpy boihttpsimgurcomayfnbyjedit  since i cant reply to others now cause of reddit block stuffa im not attacking people doing what they need to do im attacking the person calling me a wacky activist while denying that roads get widened attacking me but not minding that obscene denial of reality only signals your devotion to the cult b to youd think not dying wouldnt be wacky   youd think but car folk have a hard on for their power over non drivers i get swerved at instead of around daily almost the law backs em up my exs mom had a  year medical history of randomly passing out and never had their license revoked passed out behind the wheel and killed a guy got  years with time served
ugh what are you talking about there are a ton of people that get extremely mad if you enact any barrier affecting their ability to travel by car this includes traffic enforcement safety infrastructure bike lanes bus lanes reduced parking for better infrastructure etc people lose their minds and its a significantly bigger audience than the fuck cars people
ive heard the quote its still a dumb comment everyone can live by good public transport if we invest in it instead of investing even more in things to make private transport easier
because those drivers have to put your food somewhere and deliver to a bunch of other people as fast as possible many of whom are not  blocks away for going to any location while handling as many orders of wildly varying sizes as possible a car is by far the best solution
and not just the cost of painting lines the cost of building that surface areas worth of roadwayi mean cmon we live in a society i dont have kids and im perfectly happy for my taxes to pay for schools
its fair but unfortunately people regularly do demand progress where progress isnt possible yet i dont think they realize they are but its one of those things where people demand urbanization at the cost of existing systems the most memorable example recently was posts about removing end of line parking garages to replace them with housing which long term  great goal  but those garages fill with literally thousands and thousands of cars every day and those people are pedestrians in dc without a much stronger transit model in the suburbs bringing people to metro in way that doesnt turn a  minute drive into a  minute bus trip those cars will be at the metro garages in the suburbs or they will be in dc and  new luxury townhouses and condos wont relieve that pressure  yet so many people seemed to just take a view that existing systems need to be killed swiftly to force a change which isnt an approach anyone should want for anything with infrastructure construction im thrilled purple line is being built but im gonna be retired before its done at the current rate
car free city doesnt equal better public transportation at least in my mind se and other areas in dc and the surrounding communities do need metro access its pretty much non existent no grocery stores either
when you add that up with the time lost and everything else it very quickly becomes more convenient affordable and quick to drive sure itd be great if dc had congestion pricing or just even taxed mdva drivers coming in but they dont so here we are with some folks living without much efficient metro access
theres nothing to talk about the metro is expensive and its underdeveloped in my area   what can i do about it
youve proved your point but id also like to think its limited to chronically online redditors its sort of like how theres been so much complaints about the ogr bike lanes online but those complaints havent really done anything the ogr bike lanes are still here
ill wait
i understand what they meant but maybe you failed to realize that getting hit by a car while driving is also unsafe and that it happens far more frequently than assaults and robberies on public transit but sure keep calling me retarded for pointing out that car accidents are more dangerous and frequent in occurrence than all of the things you just mentioned
youre more likely to get injured or killed in your car than on public transportation sorry
i picked more than one spot halley is easier to walk and is still in no way convenient thats a hike for that to be a daily trip like yeanah no one but children are doing that after a long day at work i as a middle schooler walked that strip for fun but even as a kidif i saw a bus while walkingi was getting on it and riding to the station tf lol also you know good and well the other i chose is not walkable at allwhich is why you didnt respond to that location i believepeople have entire childen people sometimes take multiple bags to work especially if they do pre or after work activities like gym or social clubsdo they wanna hike  or  bags plus a bike all dayand then back to the kids one kid okay what about more than one do they all ride on the back of the ebike and then does the ebike magically turn into a car when you actually have to travel outside city limits youd have to own both so youre not really saving because you cant swap the bike for the caryou can always swipe the car for the bike tho lets also remember most ppl who live over here make under k and define under k and paying minimum  in rent  utlities like a car literally makes sense whats crazy is  people who live this experience are telling you they need the carsand youre literally attempting to invalidate that like how tf does your observation compare to people who live this experience everyday youre trying to educate me on something im far more familiar with your  years of working in the neighborhood doesnt compare to a lifetime of living and commuting in the arealike how in your mind does it even measure up
insurance costs me  a month ill probably be spending  a month on gas   expenses are very very minimal and will make up for the lost time i would be losing in transit      uberlyftmetro are expensive im not sure why people cant understand that
i live in navy yard rn but i was born and raised in seso you still live in se
how much does it cost to park and ride  what does parking at a metro station cost  how much parking is available  how much earlier in the morning does someone have to get up to park and ride
you literally just did exactly what be described which is why natives dont fw yall
this isnt a problem with se residents americans are super carcentric
lmao who the fuck is gonna get up extra early to drive their car to a parking lot pay to park then pay even more money to board a filthy metro train get to their office v the city accommodates cars most workers in downtown dc are driving into the central business district to park their car in one of many underground parking garages theyre not interested in living out carfree manhattan fantasies
sure but thats not where we live now and i think that was ops point  that much of the area particularly in lower income parts of this city its just not feasible
it is true in the context of a family its not an economical choice  so stating that its not at all true in any context is wrong   in some contexts it is in fact true
you can do the ebike thing awesome some other people can too thats great and thanks for reducing our carbon footprint butthe majority of people who are  have children families these people need family transportation  people with beach umbrellas and such thats likemillions and millions of people and all of the disabled folks and just fat folks wont be able to do the biking its just not a blanket solution
  however notjustbikes focuses on europe since hes given up on the usyoutube must exclusively show me old as fuck videos of his before he made this choice then because at least half of them are whinging about somewhere in north america often the us
the netherlands isnt just amsterdam and also has a racism and xenophobia problem like mississippi in the snot my comparison of choice
 id argue the car worship activists are worse gtfoh and go suck on a tailpipe yeeeeah  not a good look for you  take a moment and consider ops viewpoint at the idea that people who use cars arent some evil cabal of petrolworshippers but by and large decent hardworking people doing whats best for them given the reality of where they live and the transit options presented to them  yes public transit needs to be expanded but until that happens dont flame people for doing what they need to do in order to live  and yes despite what you think the fuckcars crowd is vastly more vocal and present on this subedit the person whining about people blocking him is now blocking me  good stuff  if you need to lie about what other people are saying and if you need to lie about whats actually happening maybe youre the problem  good luck growing up
if i am reading you correctly then youi are seemingly agreed in our frustration over the quite insane inescapable national barometer of americaness that the car thing has become i understand that right now there are people who need the perks of carownership to livethat is what it is but at some point the people who have more than they need should see the crazy that is the world right now this that i have to say next is probably where you will think im nutsthink we have nothing in common the world is letting us know that it  is not ok that i hopeis common knowledgethe only way to attempt to fix it is for all to stop post haste if you have help wthatif youre famous use this to link people to people if youre a politician quit bickeringdrop all the partisan shitwork together fix the worldif you still want all that mess go back at italthough this is zany but wait till its done just stop

totally i understand why people have and use cars but its not in my view an ideal state of affairs
support better transit advocate to your elected representatives theres plenty you can do other than bragging about your car on reddit
so harassment doesnt exist because it doesnt happen to you
and even google maps is saying the walk from halley to congress is leaning toward  minutes  to be exact that can be a  minute walk for someone who isnt that fit likethats not walkable
dont try arguing with the tryhard bancars whites about real lived experiences youll just end up mad and down voted
metro isnt expensive its like  during rushhour and  during the evening when an uberlyft would cost   i have zero idea why youre lumping metro in with uberlyft   insurance costs me  a month ill probably be spending  a month on gas  since i take the metro in the evening back home i buy the monthly metro pass at  so including the rush hour rides i pay month which is still cheaper than your month   edit for the last time stop dming me telling me to buy a bicycle or ebike i already own a ebike aswell as a fixie i bike more than anybody on this subreddit its simply not sustainable if you dont live in the city   man i live in the countryside in the agricultural reserve to say its not sustainable is incorrect you just dont want to do it for time reasons     like if the time is so important to you thats fine but you shouldnt act like its the cheaper option thats the point of the people here arguing for cycling and public transportation that its not great for poor people that month might be nothing to you but to a poor person its a lot of money
they moved here from iowa so theyre extra excited about using the metro and they think us locals should be too to a lot of us dmv locals who grew up here the metro is something the poor use to get around
he often compares the netherlands to the us and canada the former because its a hotbed of carcentric culture and the latter because thats where he moved from what you call whinging is him explaining why he didnt want to raise his children in north america
i mean youre generally going to find xenophobia in homogeneous cultures  since im asian id probably choose either china or japan since people wouldnt be able to tell im a foreigner just based on looks alone  but japan and china definitely have better public transportation than the us does   the tryhard ws in this sub are mad again i seenot even white dude   karens gonna karen they vote for bernie and think theyre not racists and uphold one of the most openly racist countries in w europe the netherlands as a model  racist or not its better than the us by miles in terms of cycling infrastructure and public transit you act like theres no racism in the us    why we wont raise our kids in suburbiahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohlpmxltxpw

you really are mirroring my broad point which is that we should plan for the people who live where the change will occur i dont have really strong opinions about what specifically should be done in ne but someone in columbia heights shouldnt be talking authoritatively about what precisely needs to be done at shady grove or reston thats all i was trying to mock in my original post the people on this subreddit who read a couple ggw articles and think they know the solution to the entire regions issues
im sorry but car free means exactly what it states car free if advocating for better public transit then say that youll actually garner more support
not my problem they dont want me i dont want them
what you call whinging is him explaining why he didnt want to raise his children in north americabecause for instance ontario built a parking garage next to a new commuter rail station in a semirural area clutch sustainably harvested pearls    or theres a town in canada called london and its not as cool as the one in englandi generally agree with a many of the dudes points buttheres a lot of whinging and failure to see the big picture   and a severe lack of knowing when to let a bit die
theres always at least one dutch stan gross the homogeneous excuse is gross and dishonest the dutch had a large colonial empire

we get you like your mercedesbenz this isnt about public transit at all
oh thats so satisfying
dc has a lower traffic fatality rate than all  states its also more urban than all the statescoincidence i think not
what kind of person cries about a cycle lane
welcome weve also got a nice community over at rbikedc
the only downside of living in dc is that its dc
im visiting dc right now and this is a huge part of why i dont want to go home i dumped my car in a garage and bought a bikeshare pass and im having the time of my life legs are sore but damn id get used to it
is this bike lane something new
that lane was never available to drivers it was always full of food trucks and souvenir stands sounds like bs to me edit yep as alex marshallhttpstwittercomarmarshallstatus points out this was always vendor parking it was never open to traffic but hey lets all stick with the narrative haha stupid drivers f cars i wholeheartedly support removing vendor parking f the torons
the only american thing in this picture is the flag and the truckedit why is everyone downvoting most places in america dont have such beautiful buildings and wonderful bike infrastructure thats all im saying
nah theyre pisst because they see all those bicycles zoom past them while theyre stuck in traffic
i live in dc ride my bike everywhere and love it but there is still so much work to do here i was hit by a car while i in the bike lane  months ago and im constantly scared its going to happen again most of the bike lanes are not like this and drivers constantly park in the painted bike lanes or ignore cyclists while the pedestrian  cyclist fatality rate is low we are getting in small accidents with cars often anyways i hope the city keeps making bike lanes like the one in the photo
the streetcar needs separate row and a bigger network
i know right i could bike that lane for miles so much better than driving in that traffic
you could literally travel highway speed and be across it in less than ten minutes even rhode island is bigger
people who think its a waste of spacelike the  lane roads
most people working in dc live out in the suburbs of va or md and commute in car dependent suburbanites will always hate on bike lanes that they wont use and think it should be another lane for cars instead
oh i had no idea thanks
youre right no one come youre taking all the nice apartments
if youre here sunday make sure to go to the dupont circle farmers market its right next to the metro stop cant miss it
yes and no that section of the road has always been blocked off but apparently it used to be for food trucks
said like someone who has never lived in or visted an american city for an extended period of time especially not the literal capital where of course there will be flags because those are government buildings
not even all the americans or the fucking washington monument
ive seen a lot of progress been done over the last couple of years a lot of the neighborhood streets in mt vernon have been converted to one way to add bike lanes however all of these are unprotected i think the plan to double the protected bike lanes over the next  years should see a switch in how people commute its a pain to drive in dc and everyone who lives in dmv knows that
it still manages to have more residents than wyoming and vermont and thousands more that come into the city daily for work
yes but why would you want to
how expensive is an apartment there now it was wildly expensive when i was there ten years ago im sure its even worse now
haha i grew up in the dc area so we always took field trips to museums in school its been awhile since ive been back but that bike lane did not exist for the longest time
what ive lived in texas for decades all we have are highways and parking lots i think you misunderstood the humor in my post
obelisks are egyptian

exactly my point it has lower traffic accidents because the roads are slower

pretty much nyc prices then

im honestly very confused why people are mad at me for this post the picture looks straight out of europe except for the pick up truck and the american flag thats all i was saying lighten up
boo hoo taxation without representation is why americans kicked the british out
 this means estimated
a lot of architecture in dc is inspired by european architecture and the city was designed by an frenchamerican architect you should check out this video httpsyoutubedieiquxde

waba
waba and ggwash are the two big ones but there are lots of smaller more focused groups
dont sleep on giving input to ddot near me a big road diet removing a lane and installing a protected bike lane was completed and ddot while working at a glacial pace consistently pushed it forward after a bajillion community meetings where people let their feelings about it be heard i will also add that if you come off as  anticar youll be about as wellreceived as the old folks who come to those meetings to oppose every single change imaginable be pragmatic
get involved with your ancs transportation advisory committee if your anc doesnt have one maybe find the closest committee thats  adjacent like housing after a year or so of learning how the advisory committee works within an anc structure you could potentially build support to form one
ggwash
coalition for smarter growth
check out strong towns website and forums they recently posted about how theyve set up community associations across the country for people to participate in
go to your anc meetingthe thing about local decisions is that often community input is prioritized the issue is that the people who show up to give input are generally a certain type older more conservative generally more in favor of status quos so even if they reflect a minority opinion because theyre loud they get listened to its why nimbyism is so powerful wealthy homeowners are the ones who show up to community meetingsthe way to change that is to show up as well and to argue for your position illustrate that the community isnt just anti bike lanes and anti densitydc yimbys is another good group to join
my question to you is  as you push for density walkibility in the inner city of dc do you consider the working class who often live outside the inner city who will be severely affected honestly punished by increasing the density walkibility of the inner city i often times see making dc a better place to live but the question i ask often is for who for those making enough to live in the innermost part of the city how do lowerworking class individuals work live and enjoy this same city when the commute to do so is becoming unmanageable just a thought is it truly making dc a better place to live if only certain people reap the benefits this idea of a pedestrian friendly dc is becoming a bit parasitic
thanks
how do we give ddot input
i will also add that if you come off as  anticar youll be about as wellreceived as the old folks who come to those meetings to oppose every single change imaginable be pragmaticyeah i understand that a lot of yall here live downtown or close to but many of us in residential neighborhoods arent so keen on being car free even if metrobus system improves sometimes i just want to get across towndowntown without having to rely on transit by all mean make things better and safer but dont let the needs of one group cloud what would be beneficial for everyone
might be a stupid question but are tenants allowed to join ancs im not really too sure what they are
they hold public meetings on issues regularly and request comments from the public on said issues
lol dont be dramatic residential parking isnt going anywhere prioritizing a decent eastwest busbike lane across the city or closing th street nw in admo on the weekends isnt a threat to your lifestyle truth be told i wont be happy until the bus is more convenient than driving so even if my twisted little fantasy comes true youll still have rich transit options but at some point you should remember that owning a car in a dense city is a luxury you can either pay for that luxury or embrace the burbs
anyone in the anc can attend meetings and join committees you have to be elected to actually be a commissioner
i wasnt trying to be dramatic just offering that if someone was serious about wanting to make changes it would help if they took the mindset of making things good and useful for everyone rather than just anti car folks i agree i want a complete bus system i just dont want a no car cart thats all
good points people need to stop being so afraid that their precious vehicles are going to be taken away from them they arent as there is way too much money to be siphoned out of them for that to ever happenthe truth is fewer people in personal motorized vehicles means less people on the road and less traffic which means that folks are able to get where they need to go with much less headache and hassle think about the commute people go through each day   is it really necessary for life to be that way or cam things be so much better
okay yeah thats reasonable yeah i see what youre saying better to replace car trips with a better option than ban cars first and hope better infrastructure emerges
right exactly
its how cities used to be before cars and suburban flight pay more to live in the center near everything
 the dc metropolitan area is a model for the development of walkable cities but pedestrianfriendly areas come with higher rent costs a recent report found so youre telling me that if you make a city a nice and place to be more people will want to live there shocking
interesting that dc ranks below boston after living in both i definitely think dc is much more walkable than boston
your money or your life
dont really understand how they said  of dc is walkable how could it be that low
walkable to the point where you cant cross the street without some driver trying to mow you down despite your right of way maybe our lack of traffic enforcement is not really helping this argument
lived in dc moved to tucson love tucson but miss the walkability
the golden retriever likes to walk good boye
its how most cites in the world still are american cities are aberrations in most countries if you live in the burbs its because youre too poor to afford to live closer to the city
except cities werent this expensive on average relative to incomes because property wasnt as frequently used as for capital investment until the late th centuryplenty of european cities have lower rentincome ratios and are at least as walkable as dc the difference is americas economic model for property investment
boston is much smaller though so it takes less time to walk to places
it also claims denver is more walkable than dc my experience has been oppositevirtually everyone in denver owns a car and drives even those in the most central parts of denver
dc areawhich sounds somewhat accurate given the state of most of nova outside of alexandria and arlington
every single day  it would also help if they implemented no turn on red at every downtown intersection instead of just certain ones
man i would kill for some pedestrian only streets
they blow some aggressive whistles in farragut though at the middle lane wanting to turn left people
which is weird because im pretty sure suburbs were originally designed for the opposite purpose
european cities have generally been around longer so in a way us cities are just catching up to the western global norm
if cleveland and baltimore and phoenix and la and tulsa and houston and ft lauderdale etc etc etc were all as walkable as most european cities the walkable cities in the us nyc sf dc etc would not be as expensive
try and live in central london or paris and let me know how low the rent is there
yea the size really skews it denver area is probably smaller
oh i see thanks

would be nice i just want to cross the street without someone trying to plow into me when its my green light especially when their turn is illegal to start with
the suburbs are weird man
dc is expensive because a lots of rich people have lived in and around the city for generations and the dmv is home to many of the most wealthy zip codes in america and b height restrictions dc was just was walkable in the s and s as it is now but it wasnt one of the most expensive cities in the nation back then because wealthy people hadnt started pouring in as inequality increases in the us the nations wealthiest have selfsegregated into select urban enclaves
denver is much larger at  sq milesbut theyre talking dc metro area not just he district and the va and md parts are much less walkable
also if theyre using the dc metropolitan statistical area it extends all the way west virginia including jefferson county in wv and montgomery pg charles frederick and calvert counties in md faquier loudon fairfax clarke prince william warren culpeper stafford rappahannock and spotsylvania counties in va  its an absolutely massive zone
fair  during busier hours i just feel as though a lot of drivers are too distracted by other cars  cyclists  scooters that they tend to overlook pedestrians crossing when making a right hand turn
really i feel like suburbs are super normal and boring and the city is the one that gets weird and fun
and new york and sf were just as walkable and all the other cities werent as walkable either why do you think talent aggregates to walkable and historic dc sf boston or naturally beautiful denver seattle miami and not suburban messes with little sense of urban place or historyor if you transplanted prague on top of detroit how long would it take for amazon to move in
yea
thousands of near identical houses stretching out for miles the massive scale of the conformity can be pretty damn unsettling
youre making completely baseless ahistorical arbitrary and spurious correlations you know that detroit was the rd largest and wealthiest per capita city in the us in the s right and that it once had the most expensive housing market in the nation with the worst housing shortages your assumptions are ignorant of basic us history and public policy and urban planning nashville and austin have both had some of the highest increases in rents and population in the last decade  why are you ignoring those cities which dont fit into your arbitrary categories sf is expensive because of silicon valley most of the wealthiest folks in sf work outside of the city in mountain view google or cupertino apple or menlo park facebook or palo alto and have major commutes sf wasnt always this expensive  its wealth grew with major structural shifts in the economy that exploded the tech industry in the last  years seattle was hemorrhaging jobs and people in the s  and only became an exploding city when microsoft grew on the east side and then when amazon relocated its hq into the city limits over a decade ago once again do your homeworktalent isnt attracted to these places  highearning wealthy and powerful employers are in these places dc was one of the most crimeridden impoverished places in america from the late s through the s  but its suburbs were the wealthiest zipcodes in america due to the prevalence of federal contractors and hightech service and engineering jobs and hospitals and universities disproving your point dc and boston are both small old cities with limits on growth and heigh restrictions boston is a hub of highend universities and research centers miami has mostly exploded in costs due to the rise of foreign real estate investorsthe economy labor market and cities change over time youve only proven your complete ignorance of urban planning and economic change and labor markets across the nation
yeah if everything is the same for miles isnt that normal and boring
seattle was hemorrhaging jobs and people in the s it bottomed out at a whopping  from peak population
youre say its only economy im saying its economy  attracting the type of creative and drive people who start companies do innovative art and invest in building or restoring interesting housing stockxbaustin is a perfect example its naturally beautiful and also charming but not particularly walkable it fits neatly in the denver seattle and miami category why would tech giants move there when dallas and houston offer bigger economies cheaper real estate markets and a greater absolute number of qualified workers because thats where highmobility workers want to be austin developed from a funky college town to a top  tech player because of the intangible of charm culture and vibe which is inextricably linked to how the city is laid out and the type of people it attracts by the way nashville is essentially a little austin i couldnt believe how similar the cities looked and felt nashvilles draw  and growth has evolved out of its cool factor been to knoxville latelyxbwhy did tech giants develop in sf and seattle and not boise and cleveland who are the types of ambitious dreamers that relocate to captivating exciting citiesxbwhy has new york evolved from a crime ridden pit in the s and detroit has only regressed further certainly the cool factor of the arts history and architecture plays no partxbyou cant divorce the attractiveness of a city and what draws people to it architecture walk ability culture vibe and the companies that sprout out of that ecosystem and the companies that choose to move therexbwhy would amazon pick nyc and dc for hq when they could set up shop in detroit or buffalo at  of the cost and attract whoever they want or shit pick dallas and phoenix two thriving economies if the charm and attractiveness placed no role in attracting and retaining workers and building corporate culturexbwhy would foreign buyers invest in miami which by the way has the highest amount of foreign born residents in the country at  the most internationally latin city in the country maybe the world with amazing beaches nightlife and culture when prices are lower in fort lauderdale or houston
why did these cities only become hyperexpensive in recent years decades and were not the most expensive cities in decades past answer the economy which youre ignoring youre say its only economy if highpaying and highearning individuals werent living in these places it wouldnt expensive it is first and foremost the economy  why would tech giants move there because of the research spawned from the local universities and it was initially cheaper for startups to exist there  why did tech giants develop in sf and seattlebecause silicon valley had been there for generations and because bill gates original funders and his family were in the seattle area what youre pointing at is reverse causation and youre completely ignorant of how these high paying industries have developed  who are the types of ambitious dreamers that relocate to captivating exciting citiesartists are fleeing sf and seattle in droves before corporate millionaires and tech bros have ruined these cities they are no longer cool artists cannot afford to live there and there are constant reports about how seattles culture is dying and silicon valley is an elitist den of hatehttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnologymaysiliconvalleypastorgregorystevenswealthliberals detroit has one of the best art scenes in america now in part because of this  why new york evolve from a crime ridden pit in the sbecause nyc is the epicenter of real estate speculation and the finance industry in the us  detroit has only regressed furtheryou know nothing about detroit  why would amazon pick nyc and dc for hqbecause of the existing transit systems and thriving economies
they are no longer coolthe migration figures tell a different story  there are constant reports about how seattles culture is dying people always complain when things change detroit has one of the best art scenes in america now in part because of thisaside from murals many of which have been painted by outsiders i disagree that detroit has one of the best art scenes detroit has only regressed further    you know nothing about detroiti do and i agree this supposed detroit comeback is more a work of fiction than a reality
this guy detroits
 the migration figures tell a different storycool doesnt mean what you think it means i disagree that detroit has one of the best art scenesyour opinion is beyond worthless you know nothing about art and unesco named detroit an official city of design youre ignorant and youre wrong i do and i agreeyou dont you know nothing and youre a worthless troll you spend all day crying on reddit about your pathetic life youve had years to improve your life but youre apparently incompetent
stanton and lincoln parks in capitol hill are underrated very low tourist cherry tree locales and the walk down massachusetts from union station is pretty once you get to stanton park then you could walk to eastern market or back to the capitol up e capitol st which would also be a pretty walkedit i am not a dendrologist and dont claim to know if all of these are cherry trees or the types of cherry trees you are looking for but they are pretty trees nonetheless
cleveland park georgetown dumbarton oaks tudor place oak hill cemetery has lots of beautiful trees among the amazing memorials there
heres the cherry tree maphttpscaseytreesmapsarcgiscomappswebappviewerindexhtmlidbddfeeebdcceceee of dc tons of trees off the tidal basin just pick a cluster in the area youll be in
woodley park kalorama capitol hill
mount pleasant is a beautiful stroll as is georgetown north of m street
capitol hill easily
i always go to mt plesant for this the  block of park rd nw area in particular
catholic and the basilicaand dont laugh but the freakin parking lot is gorgeous right now yes im serious we take our kid there for photos at peak bloom and then just ration them out to grandparents over the course of the year
cleveland park georgetown palisades woodley park
mount pleasant dupont capitol hill def check out dumbarton oaks estate  garden
the gingko trees on swann street
georgetown reminds me a lot of brooklyn heights in the best way possible
macarthur blvd is lined with cherry trees and is a very pretty walk its mostly sfhs not rowhouses so not like those neighborhoods in brooklyn in that sense but very much like them in the heres where you go to walk around one of the nicest neighborhoods in the city sensed will take you right there stop off at et voila for some nice belgian beer to refresh you if youre classy or grab a tallboy and a paper bag at mac market if youre not
not enough love for tenleytown in here between american u and the old houses its wonderful to walk around in always reminded me of a secluded midwest college town
cleavland or glover park lived there right after moving to the city right across from the cathedral and there is little as pretty as walking by the embassies and blossoms in the spring
lots of good recommendations on here already but really much of dc is similar to what youre looking for in my opinion it has many of the prettiest residential neighborhoods in the country
barnaby woods  doesnt feel like the city but every house is beautiful and unique and the flowers are amazing in the spring
people in this thread  list neighborhoods and areas with the highest density of undisturbed historically preserved housing built in classical architectural styles same people in other threads  anybody who supports historic preservation of the essential character of neighborhoods through requiring architectural stylistic conformity is an enemy of progress and equity theres no inherent value to preserving old buildings we should do all the rowhouse popups also modernist architecture is so sleek and cool 
trinidad and simple city are gorgeous at sunset and shortly after
the yo aka th ave se simple city congress heights trinidad  chopper city just a couple places you can walk around
its very small and im not sure theyre cherry trees but they damn sure look like it garfield park on f street se has a lot of trees that look like cherry blossoms im hesitant to call them cherry blossoms because im not  sure thats what they are but they look a lot like the ones at the tidal basin the good thing is the area is quieter and not as busy and the trees hang lower if you are the kind of person who likes to touch trees
national cemetery in hill east
there was an article in wapo the other day that might help seven spots where you can enjoy the cherry blossoms away from the tidal basinhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomdcmdvadcareacherryblossomguidelet me know if you cant access and need cutpaste
american universitys campus is very nice and the walk from the metro to campus goes past the japanese ambassadors house which has a ton of cherry blossoms lining the sidewalk
alexandria va
surprised no one has mentioned the kenwood neighborhood in bethesda md  not far from metro at friendship heights absolutely stunning  the largest grouping of cherry blossoms on dorset ave and side streets
agree with georgetown and adding brookmont in bethesda off macarthur blvd
 agree on this mass avenue to lincoln park and then east capitol to the capitol is one of my favorite walks also start at senate park outside union station before going down mass av since there are some nice blossoms there too
ooo any cherry trees among those trees im visiting tmrw to catch the blooms
im sneezing just looking at this map
wow dc is filled with cherry trees any particular areasneighborhoods besides the tidal basin that you know of that are super worth checking out
came to say mount pleasant beautiful
add georgetown and this is the list
lmaooo go head
removed
dumbarton oaks garden is well worth the price of admission in the spring and they have some cherry treeshttpswwwdoaksorgvisitgardenexplorecherryhill
something people always forget the japanese embassy on mass ave has beautiful cherry blossom trees start at massachusetts  wisconsin and go straight to dupont for a nice walk
not neighborhood but the arboretum is supposed to be a real treat when it comes to cherry blossoms less busy more space equally as beautiful
its not in dc but kenwood neighborhood in bethesda about two miles from dc line has a ton of mature ones and becomes quite a destination during peak bloom
stay west of the river
there a problem
i was there yesterday definitely lots of cherry blossoms and lots of space magnolias too though not much else yet
why do you mean the potomac river thatd be virginia right
the anacostia
id recommend doing a loop from the ww memorial to mlk and through the fdr when you get to the bridge turn around rinse repeat ive done that loop a solid  times over the years for sure
the museums around the mall there are tons of stops and the dc pogo community usually put lures on them i usually meet up with friends around the smithsonian castle
awesome thanks
this was great advice about as good a cd as ive ever had so thanksany advice on how to get involved in hoopa raiding tomorrow  is there a group planning to walk the mall to hit them i could join
thanksany advice on how to get involved in hoopa raiding tomorrow  is there a group planning to walk the mall to hit them i could join
ive done that walk as well i cant make it tomorrow but i know youll see other players good luck
surprised that no one has mentioned this yet but old town alexandria would be my first choice
these arent favorites per se but i have a rundown frederick pretty sizeable similar to old town in that way so lots of options and its a shame the brunswick line isnt more feasible annapolis the waterfront is nice but the sprawl immediately around there is real bad and the historic core is smaller hagerstown you start to stretch the definition of near dc here but the city is pretty sizeable which surprised me however its fairly run down you can see the difference distancetodc makes between here and frederick ellicott city very small but worth a visit if youre in the baltimore area winchester in between frederick and hagerstown literally too culpepper you can take the train not very big but the downtown is pretty bustling every time ive been warrenton a little bigger and a little closer than culpepper but yet seems to have less on offer fredericksburg the college nearby helps and while it doesnt really have a classic waterfront like annapolis does that does help a bit its just getting there thats a pain harpers ferry beautiful scenery but actually very small brunswick bigger town than youd think for how lowkey things are lovettsville higher home values than brunswick but smaller core but theyre doing a really good job building up that area to not just be suburban sprawl will be neat to see it like  years leesburg once you actually get past all the  traffic you can have a nice time purcellville notable for being at the end of the wod probably breaks a record for breweries per square mile manassas  a lot of potential and whats there isnt too bad but one thing i do hate about these historic downtowns also being county seats is the way the local courthouse just absolutely kills a big chunk of what could be nice if youre gonna have a superadmin complex at least make it work with the street better fairfax see above towson far but a nice walkable suburban addition to baltimore sheperdstown wv does a better job of what you might think harpers ferry does when it comes to being an actual town waterfordhillsborohamiltoncliftonboonsboropoint of rocksmiddleburgmarshallsperryvillewashington vaoccoquan i lump these together because theyre not much more than a street or two but they are interesting enough to detour off the main road if youre interested front royal again fairly wasted potential compared to winchester up the roada couple more  chesapeake beach again very small but nice for a day trip  might as well explicitly mention richmond and baltimore if you havent actually visited yet but theyre big enough that they have multiple nodes within those cities  eastoncambridge on the eastern shore if you can handle the bay bridge traffic  harvre de grace north of baltimore  catonsville has a small historic downtown completely surrounded by inner suburbs of baltimore but its there less so in glen burnie
depends on how near were talking but downtown ellicott city is pretty cute
shepherdstown wv
cumberland is small but i think all the water around it makes it really pretty
those places all have walkable downtowns but its still a challenge to live carfree there as things like grocery stores and the like arent in the walkable core i lived in frederick and visited harpers ferry a lot both have great downtowns but you cant live there car free like dc transit is terrible and the road surroundings are high speed stroads that are dangerous to bike on or even acrossi live carfree daytoday but i moved from frederick to dc to do so
perhaps a bit further out but lancaster pa seemed to have walkable streets when i was there for a few days of course this was close to their restaurants and bars
heres a fewfrederickfredericksburgannapolisleesburgwinchesterculpeperobviously baltimore also qualifies
downtown silver spring
old town across the river
hampden neighborhood of baltimore st michaels md middleburg va
town center rockville is also quite nice
 bethesda
middleburg virginia
richmond va two hours south  several cute walkable neighborhoods carytown museum district the fan church hill  jackson ward to name a fewi made the move down here and its been great
gordonsville va its not at the level of some of the other citiestowns mentioned and you have to have a car if you were to live there but the downtown area is super cool and walkable give it a few years and it will start to be mentioned more and more in lists like these
despite the fact that its bisected by three major roads the wheaton triangle is surprisingly walkable and is full of restaurants bars barbershop grocery stores the mall movies gym and metro
fredericksburg va
silver spring because its one of the most urban downtowns and i like urban city centers plus it has so many bars and restaurants for happy hour which is definitely more my speed
baltimores inner harbor and fells point
brunswickeastonmtairy
st michaels
its a bit more of a drive out in southern maryland but i love to go for an outing at solomons island theres a park beach area there across from the bridge that allows for swimming
colonial williamsburg va not sure about living there but its fun to visit
occoquan is pretty neat
there are a lot of neighborhoods in baltimore you can live car free if you want fells point fed hill riverside charles village hampden really most of the rowhouse neighborhoods in the city you could do it though it would be difficult leaving the neighborhood so you might need a car for occasional trips out but if you lived along the light rail you can get to a lot of spots without a car easily
brunswick mdbeans in the belfry is probably the cutest coffee shop ive ever been to
bethesda not north bethesda ballston alexandria king street clarendon
staunton but frederick is nice  my wife prefers lexington  hagerstown is really interesting but pretty sad  i thought charlottesvilles downtown was pretty dull
arlington
how has clarendon not been mentioned
ballstonrosslyn corridor in arlington super walkable access to  metro stops right next to dc and cheaper renttaxes than dc win win win
none of those places are near dc
downtown fredericksburg is pretty cute and has some great antique shops
shirlington
charlottesville va is worth the trip  so is roanoke
never thought charlottesville was near dc
dc is my answer
new york
baltimore
as someone who grew up in va so many of these responses are insane lmao either the most depressing shitholes andor the type of place i have to drive through fast so i dont get out near any confederate flags
culpeper is fun
federal hill in baltimore and society hill in philadelphia are realistically places you could live without a car obviously farther and already in an urban city though

richmond baltimore philly

a lot has been said already so ill suggest wilmington de
fairfax city
i think the charm of this area is how many one horse towns there are hidden across the suburban hell scape falls church is a little bigger but there is a brick paved part of e broad st westover between there and arlington is also adorable brookville in chevy chase legitimately feels one horse takoma park is gorgeous the list goes on and on
for a bunch of people who dont seem to care about borders very much you all seem to care a lot about borders
theres something perverse about asking which downtown walkable areas people like to drive to this is especially true when names like charlottesville and richmond are being thrown in as options each of which takes over an hour to get to
live just south of old town and its incredibly walkable plenty of bikeshare stations as well so you can cover a lot of ground you can even bike to del ray which is also a nice walkable community
i think old town usually would be the first answer lol
right i moved to ot alx and refuse to look back i am now one of those old and moldy  across the river yeah im out groupies
i think most people consider that part of dc the same way bethesda silver spring and arlington are you can take the metro to old town
id add st michaels and berlin to your eastoncambridge composite for the eastern shore
awesome list i am saving it since i wanted to visit all of the main streets in the area 
all of these are places that living car free is possible but far less convenient outside of certain trips
this is spot on
nice compilation  thanks
highly recommend chestertown which for my money is one of the quaintest towns reachable from dc it is an outstanding town
surprised you left out middleburg
its quaint as fuck i absolutely love downtown ec and catonsville
i agree that ellicott city is pretty cool i went there for the first time with my wife a few years ago and we were really taken by it after dinner there it started to rain as we were walking to our car later that night we saw on the news that a couple hours later the whole area where we had been walking that day was underwater with people trapped in buildings and getting washed away it was crazy then they had another similar flood a couple years later cute town but they have to fix that drainage problem
went there randomly after a day trip to antietam because there wasnt much in the actual town of sharpsburg and had a very pleasant time i guess the college being there helps if i didnt have my exhausted and sticky kids from ice cream down the block i would have liked to peruse the record shop
huge drugs problem there though not a good place to live
its been  years but i didnt get a good feeling or enough to make it a recommended walkable down town  it seemed like they were still stuck in coal mining days
i live in annapolis and would have a hard time living without a car perhaps in the parole town center
downtown silver spring has one of the ugliest most inchoate and unwalkable downtowns ive ever encountered for a city its size
this is a crawlable downtown
it has one maybe two walkable streets lol can be done in  hour
shhhh keep it secret
really awesome food too i travel down just to eat on occasion 
walk to the lovely brookside gardens in wheaton regional park
i love fredericksburg
boring af
go on a friday in summer theres music arts anything but dull
agreed clarendon is it
i love this answer
pittsburgh too all suburbs of dc
thats in md yeah
plus the free trolley on king street makes it fairly accessible to the metro
i grew up in arlington and would never consider it a part of dc ill tell people im from virginia or the dc area but never washington dc all the places you mentioned are very separate from dcproper  because of a river in the cases of arlington and old town and because of a substantial distance from downtown for bethesda and silver spring
 i think most people consider that part of dc the same way bethesda silver spring and arlington areif by most people you mean nearly nobody
most people  transplants and people who never lived in dc
lol no i grew up in arlington county and nobody ever said they were from dc if you were talking to someone from outside the region you would say either northern va or outside dc maybe transplants tend to say that but its not really a thing for long term residents i imagine its the same for the other inner suburbs
im honestly surprised that comment got so upvoted i honestly didnt think many people period but especially on dc were familiar with it but it really is the train museum is imo the definition of quaint
the issue in ellicott city is that its at the bottom of a stream valley and there was way too much development with massive amounts of pavement built upstream so water that would normally seep into the ground was being funneled directly towards ec the derisively nicknamed rain tax that was passed near the end of omalleys second term would have helped mitigate this as impermeable surfaces would be taxed with revenue going to storm water management hogan pushed for a full repeal as part of his first campaign and while it wasnt fully repealed it was neutered to the point that it become completely meaningless
grew up in that area they voted out the old county exec and brought in a new one who worked with community and businesses to implement flood control havent had flooding issues to that extent since  not to say it wont happen but there has been a cognizant effort since calvin ball came in to do appropriate flood and emergency control id also say if you go to oec doing the drive to catonsville is also nice
admiral analogs has a great selection if you like wine i also highly recommend grapes and grains  every single person there knows their wine they have a great selection and they will recommend something really great i regularly walk in and tell them the flavor profile ive been craving and they point me to something new to me and perfect love them
the biggest thing lacking in dta is grocery access theres basically nothing convenient without having a car
i largely ignored the last part of the ops comment  i wouldnt want to live in dc without a car even if it is not uncommon for me to go  days without driving and sometimes up to  weeks without driving
explain what you mean plenty of wide sidewalks full blocks and pedestrian cut throughs this is the first ive heard your take
one of the ugliest most inchoate and unwalkable downtowns ive ever encountered for a city its sizeits not perfect by any means but its definitely not this
you have a different opinion and thats okay
if you stick to the east side of georgia its not bad
false
i do feel like they do a good job of fitting a lot of stuff in those couple of streets if you live in middleburg proper you have a grocery store pharmacy bars restaurants a post office a pool a library a hardware store several churches a couple of banks and lots of boutiques all within easy walking distance if you work from home you can easily accomplish most of your daily tasks without needing to hop into a car
food recs please pretty please
yeah the old town is so cute
lol as someone who grew up near williamsburg i concur i loathed when my parents would have guests and wed take them to williamsburg its cool to visit for a school field trip or if youre really into american history but its not a fun place to hangout or live all the restaurants are old school fancy like something your grandparents would enjoy theres nothing hip or cool for even adults in their s and s the only thing fun in williamsburg is busch gardens
i mean if you want to sit in one spot and listen to music at the pavilion and get a bite to eat or drink sure its fine but its just one not very long street e main just one strip of restaurants and a couple of shops  i always leave feeling like we missed half of it or something especially if we didnt drive to monticello or a winery earlier in the day  its probably also the fact it takes about  hours to drive there on a saturday depends on what i looks like so thats  hours of drive time for four short blocks of a few restaurants cvs a couple of shops and a pavilion and im being honest here and offer that i know art is subjective but ive yet to have enjoyed anything ive watchedheard enough to stay longer than  minutes  if it was closer id think it was great but its not

thank youit really urks me how transplant thinking gets so many upvotes but when actual locals speak its ignored
exactly the same situation and answer as you here the default answer for people outside the region was just outside dc or northern va
lmao okay sure nobody who lives in arlington bethesda silver spring or alexandria has ever said they live in dc before none of those places have their own msas and bethesda and silver spring arent even incorporated cities and alexandria and arlington only exist as such because they were literally part of dc
reminds me of the time i was living in mount pleasant and took a trip to san francisco met a couple at a bar and asked them where they were from and they said dc i asked what part and they said ashburn
this post is about separate downtowns for other cities not places that are technically not dc if someone is living in dc going to arlington is not leaving town for a new place it is the same place
if you were going to dc from arlington would you say you were going out of town or would you treat it like going to a different neighborhood in town nobody is saying theyre not distinct entities but if someone is looking for a day trip from dc arlington is still in town
im originally from dc but now live in catonsville right off frederick road i absolutely love it i wish it wasnt as far from dc and my office in bethesda but it was affordable and a great community ec too
its also meant to host a lot of people and street concerts etc its not supposed to be a sleepy little hamlet
what kind of food do you like lots of fantastic places
sno to go is  tho
its  blocks full of bookstores cute shops  restaurants bars and live music charlottesville is a foodie town and several of its best restaurants are either on the mall or adjacent to it its a small town and i was never claiming it was greenwich village or even adams morgan also i dont know where youre coming from but its  hours from dc you get off  at gainesville and take  all the way down once there you are a short drive from mountains wineries swimming lakes and of course tons of history its impossible to be bored in charlottesville
and once they made it free believe it or not service improved tremendously the more traveled routes come every  minutes all day around both rush hours the duke street one comes every  oh and they added a lot of electric busses its so much easier to breathe in those no lie
the price is a little steep to use that reliably as transit
alexandria and arlington only exist as such because they were literally part of dclike seriously read a book or something alexandria was founded in  in fact dc was created in large part because of the presence of alexandria and georgetown which also predates dc
nowhat you said doesnt just correlate to this post and each of those places are its own individual cities i know plenty if people who are from dc and the greater metro area who never walked or really explored those stated areas
not really it is arbitrary but going to arlington is a very different from going to tenleytown or adams morgan or eastern market and growing up heading into dc felt substantially different from going to ballston or westover or even falls church they are not the same town there are a lot of cultural differences i wouldnt recommend arlington or silver spring for a day trip from dc but since there isnt really anything to do in either place that you couldnt find somewhere in the city but anyone who considers them to actually be part of dc is showing they dont really understand the region
i am very open to various cuisines so just throw out some of your faves
depends if you live near any of the destinations and are trying to go carfree the unlimited pass is  for a year its a good deal if you only commute to work a couple days a week and some folks with suvs spend that on gas every couple weeks httpswwwcityexperiencescomwashingtondccitycruiseswatertaxiannualpasshttpswwwcityexperiencescomwashingtondccitycruiseswatertaxiannualpass
as such  the borders and modern political entities of alexandria and arlington are a direct result of their inclusion and later separation from dc id tell you that maybe you should be the one to read a book but you cant even properly read a reddit comment so that might be hard for you
the post mentions frederick charlottesville and anapolis  places that are distinct incorporated cities not on the dc metro system anyone with a brain can understand that this person lives in dc and wants to know about other fully separate downtowns yes technically bethesda and old town are not dc we all know this but for all intents and purposes they are because you can take the metro from one to the other the greater metro area goes so so far beyond these inner burbs which directly border dc if you live in gan ness downtown bethesda is your closest downtown samw with silver spring and brightwood takoma and takoma park arlington and georgetown etc etc youre being incredibly pretentious and are up on a high horse about nothing when the post is specifically about cities that are not dc with walkable downtowns nobody is saying that bethesda is part of dc but if you live in dc going to bethesda or old town is staying in town nobody in their right mind would say they were going out of town if they went to old town but they definitely would if they went to charlottesville
if you live in various parts of dc the downtown of bethesda arlington or silver spring would easily be the closest downtown central district and sure as a child those felt like vastly different places to you because you were a child and didnt have a sense of how close it all was im sure children eotr feel the same way when they go to the zoo and if were defining things by cultural differences bethesda and arlington are much closer culturally to the traditionally affluent parts of dc west of the park than those dc neighborhoods are to anywhere eotr

ok the places you named are not considered dcnothing pretentious about it hurt dogs hollereach place is unique and has its own culture history and environment
if youre living in the washington dc area and you refer to dc you are likely talking about the cityproperfor example lets say youre currently living in arlington and you tell a friend im thinking about moving to dc they will understand that although you already live in the dc area you are considering moving within the city limits other terms often used when referring to the cityproper include the district the city and downtownif youre living in texas and you tell a fellow texan friend that youre moving to dc sure that could be inclusive of arlingtonalexandriafairfaxpgetc context is importantnow maybe the question was about areas outside the metro area but not too far outside the examples provided do mostly line up with that interpretation although id consider frederick part of the washington dc metro nasty commute though
second zzq fancy buscuit also really like though its nothing special just fantastic people
if you live in dc and are going to arlington for the day would you say you were going on a day trip out of town
youre getting so defensive and caught up in the wording youre not seeing the forest for the trees might be time to log off and interact w some people who actually live irl so you can calm down and be less butthurt about these evil suburban neighborhoods being called essentialy dc again nobody in their right mind would say theyre going out of town if they went to old town for the day so for someone living in dc looking for other cities to visit that are not dc these immediately neighboring suburbs are not a different city
no im saying im going to alexandria or arlingtonwhen im going to dc i say im going to dcwhen i say im going to temple hills i say im going to temple hills
the wordingyou are the only one trying to defend a reason to call bethesda dc
correct you name them like you would neighborhoods within a city system not like youre going to a new city separate from where you live arlington is as much a separate city from dc as the small neighborhood of temple hills is thank you for proving my point
one last time  if you were going to walk around downtown bethesda would you tell people youre going out of town
reston would put you on the washington  old dominion trail and you could bike back to dc hitting breweries on the wayherndon doesnt seem particularly close to anythingit looks like theres a cricket field next to innovation center maybe you could watch a game with local teamsdulles is the airport but theres a bus connection to the udvar hazy air and space museumloudoun gateway nopeashburn laser tag
silver line to dulles expands your options to places you can walk to from any airport in the world
reston town center has reston town center also close access to the wod trailherndon has a very very small wetlands preserve near it south side just west of the station might be hard to access due to construction the station is also a mile or so south of old town herndon which has civic buildings restaurants and a breweryinnovation center doesnt have much of note right now lots of apartments townhomes and airport hotels there are a couple restaurants a block from the south entrance arrowbrook center is a little less than a mile away with a large sports parkthe airport stop only has an airport nothing else thereloudoun gateway is a parking garage thats itashburn has loudoun station a residential mixed use center lots of restaurants on a single street but its an island in a sea of largelot single family houses and strip mallspower centers
we dont walk anywhere in suburban virginia
all those places are park and ride fairfax and beyond are antiwalkability
none of those destinations can compete with washington dc as a walkable destination nova is the epitome of car culture sprawl if they had put the metro underground that would have eventually created urban corridors like you see in arlington
dcist just posted an article answering this question httpsdcistcomstorymetrosilverlinevadaytripsdestinationsudvarhazykingspalostrhino
great idea on biking back to dc i would never have thought of that nor watching a cricket game thank you for sharing your knowledge
historic herndon is about a  minute walk from the station which isnt exactly close but it is potentially walkable there are a couple of blocks of restaurants cafes shops and barsbreweries you can definitely spend an afternoon hanging out there especially in the summer when they tend to have festivals and stuff
the wiehle station which is already opened is actually better connected to the wod trail
ha ha thats a unique way to look at it if only airlines would accept a metro transfer
not even that  the ashburn metro aside from loudoun station is surrounded pretty much entirely by data centers  giant plots of land with non descript grey box buildings surrounded by high security fences  its a necessary evil as this very comment is probably routing through there in some way almost all internet traffic does and reddit is hosted by amazon whos data centers are there but boy is is ugly and desolate
thanks for taking the time to write such an extensive reply ill investigate what reston town center has that seems to be the most promising of your suggestionscome to think of herndon sounds interesting too
i dont suppose therell be shuttles to one loudoun
reston station has no garage
thanks for the link
i bet some knucklehead at wmata will come up with a promotional scheme giving people a  discount on planetometro transfers and theyll spend  million dollars implementing it then raise fares again
but the tax dollars think of all those tax dollars
happy to help reston town center is about a  minute walk from the station has a bunch of shops restaurants plazas etc its certainly worth checking out if youve never been
the  bus will service one loudoun but very infrequently i would not rely on itloudoun countys bus system is very sorry
since there is currently one to the wiehle station i would be shocked if that wasnt routed to ashburn or loudoun gateway
united used to have a partnership with amtrak where they would sell flights from the philadelphia train station to newark which were actually just a train it was actually pretty sweet an mile connecting flight on a tiny plane is incredibly annoying and wasteful and because the train was ticketed like a flight you were protected if amtrak caused you to miss a connection
ehthere isnt anything particularly special about reston town center  least nothing id consider being worth going out of someones way to go to  but if you have to pick a place to go on the new section of silver that isnt the airport its probably the best bet
it has been so hard coded in my brain to ignore the rtc metro station and the other five that even knowing i am reading comments about it finally opening my mind still defaulted to thinking you were talking about wiehlereston east i was about to reply saying that is definitely not a fiveminute walk lol
thats really cool and you probably got united miles for it too
yeah its a collection of the most corporate chain restaurants and shops i dont think theres anything there that isnt at tysons m of metro ahead of it where you get more options and somehow still cheaper
around dc  arlington particularly around the metro stations  alexandria old town del ray arlandria if you cant afford those spots  bethesda rockville or silver spring in moco but those three areas cover a lot of distance so you have to be specific about where in those areas but again close to the metro  hyattsville or college park in pg county note for all those the term suburb doesnt really apply except in the sense that its not in dc there are areas inside dc proper that definitely feel more suburban than all those places around baltimore you have towson and probably others but im not as familiar 
silver spring by a huge marginwithin  blocks of downtown silver spring and the metro station is a pedestrian street with a fountain next to an indoor mall feat dave  busters an ice skating rink two movie theaters including the american film institute theater with alcohol two breweries soon to be three the fillmore music venue dozens of bars quarry house and restaurants three live performance theaters playscomedy a new beautiful library with d printing also containing the levine school of music an american legion with showscomedy the bo railroad station and museum literally the best ethiopian restaurants in the country the noaa wave pool fountain awesome in the summer and the dinosaurs at the discovery building but those are going away sadly walkingbike paths directly connecting to sligo creek and the trail that leads all around dc friends of the library used book store great for browsing next to a dog park walking for dogs and literally every store and service you could possibly need
umadmoneymcgee had it right i would just add for  and  around the metro stations as they specified for arlington all of the areas have far flung nonwalkable areas on top of that there is the city of falls church which is walkable but boring as umadmoneymcgee also pointed out i guess we can add in the mosaic district too and reston down center they are walkable but isolated and there isnt much to do i suppose wheaton could also be added 
depending on your priorities maybe consider west falls church cheaper and less developed than arlington or silver spring less nightlife but lots of shops restaurants and green space convenient to metro  and the wod 
merrifield at dunn loring station is completely walkable to dog parks grocery stores salons dry cleaners too many to count restaurants drs dentists stores in mosaic inculding target a movie theater and farmers market 
dc  bethesda arlington old town alexandriabaltimore  towson downtown catonsville old ellicott city they are working on rebuilding after the disastrous flooding still worth checking out
ive lived in both downtown bethesda and downtown silver spring both are very walkable but definitely have different vibes to me bethesda felt more like a town to me whereas silver spring felt more like a neighborhood in dc even though its outside the city the walkable area of bethesda is bigger and had more things to do  but in silver spring everything you need is within a few blocks i also think bethesda felt a little more family oriented fwiw i think youll find suburban feeling neighborhoods in dc i live in van ness which is pretty quiet and feels a bit suburban at times while theres less to do in van ness than bethesda or silver spring it is a lot easier to get to other areas of dc 
im not sure if this is what you are looking for but there is a joke that baltimore itself is a suburb of dc speaking to south baltimore in particular  the daily commute to dc is easy there are a few neighborhoods close to a marc station theres a dog park at latrobe other parks for the pups are riverside federal hill and fort mchenry basically you will be near a dog friendly park there are great restaurantsbarsshops within walking distance and the grocery stores are walkable or in the alternative deliver short walk to inner harbor which is also a great walk with pups and the rest of the city is just a quick walk or uber away this might not be exactly what you were looking for but as i mentioned previously it is somewhat of a joke that baltimore is a suburb of dc the commute is easy col is better and the general atmosphere is pretty laid back regardless best of luck in your search edit reduced my wall of text 
all of arlington most of alexandria old town del rayhuntingtontysons now near the malls if you like mallsmost of dc  silver spring college park hyattsville
downtown bethesda regular bethesda isnt walkable arlington alexandria downtown silver spring etc
thanks i guess what im looking for are suburbs that either feel like towns with a main street or like small cities in the case of arlington im looking at a job in dc but im trying to research places that may be affordable but arent sprawlstrocities 
downtown silver spring  
by the same token takoma park has a bunch of cute restaurants parks farmers market and other quirky things you would still need a car but its accessible to all the stuff in silver spring which helps 
theres a railroad museum i had no idea im so going to go there soon i love trains
we just moved to downtown silver spring so this post is really useful
ive also heard its like the nonprofit capital or something which is neat ill have to add it to my list 
while silver spring is lively and has everything it feels a bit different from all the other places mentioned in this post feels a bit messier dirtier and unpleasant in comparison with the rest i must clarify that ive only been to the downtown part of it 
wheaton gets bonus points for having some of the best international food in the whole dmv
oh and the actual city of falls church the city of fairfax and vienna also have small historic centers but are further out than any of the places i mentioned 
affordable but walkable is super hard to come by around here  but there are an almost unlimited number of good fun walkable neighborhoods in and around dcas someone with similar desires as you i would recommend trying to just rent an apartmenthouse as close to your work as possible as long as you work in dc and just spend the extra money for at least a year to try out the area while simultaneously having a really easy commute and the extra free time that brings
king street in alexandria old town maybe  or frederick if you can consider that a suburb 
i think del ray is exactly what youre looking for
city of falls church or vienna 
check out the westover neighborhood in arlington  there is a small main street where you run into your neighbors  not a ton there but enough to have a good time  there are some very affordable garden style apartments along the eastern edge of the main shopping drag  maybe  a mo for a  bedroom or studio
takoma is lovely 
bo in the old silver spring station i believe theyre doing an open house tomorrow try out the vietnamese place lotus cafe across georgia its a hole in the wall type spot but it is good 
eh im used to philly sterile clean feels a little weird to me as as theres not trash everywhere 
well it is a city  no more dirty or unpleasant than dupont circle though
yeah its different because theres more to do
this is why silver spring was always better than the whiter suburbs it has diversity
i agree but wheaton has a ton of ms problems 
yeah if im planning to rent for the first year anyway that makes sense hyattsville seems to be fairly affordable so if we do the suburbs we might go with that i like that they claim to have an arts district and they seem to have some community involvement 
they asked for affordable del ray is picture perfect for the type of setting they are looking for but affordable it aint unless youre a mid career professional couple 
well i dont recall it being compared to dupont circle in this thread i just compared it to the other ones mentioned 
thats a huge exaggeration it is an issue but you dont encounter that  of the time you walk around wheaton
not really ms is way overhyped and not an issue unless you are a undocumented immigrant living around them they are also far more active in va but either way they arent going to bother you 
theres also takoma park  much more community focused like the san francisco of the east coast culturewise if thats your thingbut if youve never done it before many havent living within walking distance to your work is one of the greatest and most underrated things in the world  and its possible in dc unlike most places  you get a neighborhood and get to experience it on foot every dayyou can always live in the suburbs later
dupont circle is a comparable city neighborhood like silver spring  and thats unrelated to the other comments in this thread chosen solely to illustrate
dupont is too dangerous to live in 
 ms is way worse in va they arent the threat the media makes them out to be they pray on latin immigrants who are not documented and cannot easily go to the police if you do not fall into this category ms has no interest in you and you will have to go out of your way to make them a problem 
good point  i still go to wheaton and dont discourage it but if one is planning on living there then it is something to consider
oh i know the chances of them messing with me a non latino is very unlikely but still there was a case recently where a ms house in wheaton beat a yr old prostitute with a bat breaking her arms and legs sorry but i dont want to live next door
is this a joke or
point  is important for people to know its like when the murder rate is quite high in dc youre really only at risk if youre selling drugs in se
youre not there isnt that many of them and even if lived next door to them you wouldnt know as they wouldnt interact with you if you want to avoid ms though just stay out of va being latino is not what it is important to ms they prey on undocumented immigrants that is their racket the people they pray on are afraid to go to the police 
i  had a friend who was asked for money in a really condescending way recently
not really there isnt a lot of ms anywhere in the dc area and nobody is going to run into them its like telling someone to watch out moving to dc because there are bloods in dc technically this is true but it is not an issue for  of people 
good point doesnt pg county riverdale hyattsville etc have more of a problem
langley park has been the subject of several papers videos and i think even a movie about ms violence
financially my favorite part about dc is how easy it is to live car free is my rent a little higher sure but i come out wayyyy ahead with no car payments insurance payments maintenance costs etc i have a bike and metro and thats all ive ever needed i cant even remember the last time i ubered in terms of quality of life i love the diversity of dc but i love the diversity thats within walking distance for me i can walk to just about any type of barrestaurantcuisine i could imagine are there things id change definitely but i cant imagine living in another us city and being as happy as i am here
im originally from california but i lived in philly for  years before moving to dc ive been in dc for  years now and just bought a condo so planning on staying for the long haul i love all the culture that dc has to offer there are so many museums theaters and other points of interest here its awesome to walk to the national mall in the evening grab some food from a food truck and just sit and enjoy all the scenery not to say philly doesnt have any of this because of course it does but not on the same scale as dc the job market here is profoundly better i struggled to find good jobs in philly my salary in philly topped out at k ive more than doubled my salary since moving and yes the col is higher here but not x as expensive for comparison rent in philly was  vs  here for very similar apartment buildings my husband also got a huge pay bump when we moved here though not quite as drastic as mine so overall we are in a much more comfortable place financially even though its a little more expensive also the pure number of job opportunities here is staggering compared to philly at least in my fieldi also prefer the diversity of dc there are people here from all over the country and world i like that i meet tons of other people from california for example i feel like less of an outsider here because so few of the people i work with and have become friends with are from here philly has a really intense local culture that i never grew to enjoy in phillys favor the restaurant scene there is a lot better dc has decent restaurants but philly was a foodie heaven one of my favorite things about going back to philly is going to as many restaurants as possible do i ever miss philly oh yeah i miss walking around university city when all the students return and its buzzing with excitement i miss the cobblestone streets of old city and walking through elfreths alley to get home i miss the friends i made there reading terminal market the german christmas village in december penns landing in the summer and the proximity to nyc i miss how well i knew my way around by the end of  years but its just a short train ride away and i go back and visit often enough well i did prepandemic to get my fix tbh i think both are great places to live and which to live in just depends on what you value most
this isnt want you wanted to hear but tbh if i had a work opportunity in philadelphia and plenty of friends and family there i would move to philly in a heartbeat its an awesome town theres nothing better than being near the people you love and youll save a boatload of money and i say this as someone who loves dcdcs not going anywhere without you get amtrak deals and come to dc any saturday you want for  youll still save money
caveating that my experience has been that i moved here to work in politics and have worked in that field for over a decade for that greatest place in the us the way people think here how worldly it is how you can go from a national brewers reception to a french embassy party and tuck into a conversation on global vaccine distribution cant get that in philly for everything else huge fan great coffee easy to get around excellent food not quite as a little slice of everything as new york but you can find a niche or a group that fits who you are pretty easily covid makes that a little harder but thatll change id say the two are just as neighborhoody you hang out where you live mostly ive lived in the capitol hill neighborhood for the entirety and its awesome i had eastern market barracks row and h st when i was a more booze and dating driven youngster now i have a close daycare a quiet neighborhood always had it here and i can still booze with buddies nats park is a  minute drive away however ill say this whatever you decide when you look back in ten years itll be the people that you will remember fondly the things you did the jokes you shared places fit into that but matter less
lived in philly from  to  dc  and  to present my take is mostly about the flavor of each city the feeling of moving through it the buildings the urban spaces etcphilly is rugged their sports mascot is called gritty for good reason it has endless blocks of historic buildings  gorgeous victorian rowhouses and twins that just go on and on and on for miles in all of south philly there are practically no trees north philly has substantial areas of deep poverty with countless abandoned houses many of them utterly beautiful it has tremendous untapped potential it has huge postindustrial brownfields and ruins and active industrial sites the city is famous as the heart of colonial america but its really an industrial age city that exploded outwards after the civil war it tends toward the gothic the overwrought queen anne the blue collar its most thriving areas  the core of center city south street the general upenn area manayunk  arent well connected to each other but are sometimes shocking with their levels of east coast bustle i lived in west philly near clark park and felt wonderfully comfortable nestled in a cozy neighborhood with lots happening around me dc is polished the historic core is quite small and it runs out into suburbanstyle development with shocking speed there are very few abandoned buildings here and certainly no neighborhoods at a level of decay comparable to say erie ave or lehigh ave in philly everything here has been developed or redeveloped the streets are mostly alive and feel comfortable and safe if a bit bland sometimes things are leafy and green many of the most active spots are connected  th street u street th street the physical geography of your life will be a lot smaller here the city is all about its founding era history the architecture is dominated by the federal the classical greek and colonial revival  though gorgeous italianate made some serious inroads after the civil warthey both have deep history astonishingly huge city parks wissahickon valley and rock creek are remarkably similar parks a lot going on good rail connections to other cities transit systems that could be okay if theyd sink serious rehab money into them both great cities tough choice good luck
among other things i really appreciate the weather here winters can be tough but it definitely is a place with four distinct seasons and spring and fall seasons are fantastic imoalso the diversity of experiences you can have in the region are really great want mountains we got it beaches not too far away train rides to other major cities or direct plane rides to europe yup or maybe you want quieter countryside thats around here too its quite nice to have all of that onhand
dont underestimate the importance of where all of your family and friends live dc is great but moving here without knowing many folks would be kinda tough even without an ongoing pandemic
dc is a networking rich city  when things open back up and you want to make contacts in your field this is a pretty neat area to do that that can apply to a ton of industries too so if its possible id save some money and do philly for a hot minute with an eye to dc a year from now
my wife and i just moved here in may for her new job and here are some of the things i love after moving here from texasthe weather is much better  dc summer is hot but its not texas hot  dc is humid for sure but there were cool days here in the summer that i didnt get before  fall weather has been amazing so far  always something to do  theres just always something going on and something to go see  weve visited a ton of museums and still have many to go to  the food here is pretty damn good  i definitely miss tx bbq and texmex hard af to find a good flour tortilla here but overall there is a ton of good food around herethe metro is dope  well when its working normallynow what i dont liketakes  years to go  mile here in a carstreets are absolutely the worst ive ever encountered in my life  i swear i can hear my cars suspension crying out in pain
hi chiming in bc i havent heard others mention it but dc is also a much more international city than philly think of all the embassies here and events they have the huge diaspora communities around the area and the bomb food that comes along with it it sounds to me like youre debating whether or not to take a leap outside your comfort zone assuming philly is home and if thats the case move here if you hate you go back no big deal but give yourself the experience to grow and hit up the thread when you move i bet lots of folks will take you out for a beer and show you around 
personally i like the low cost of living and the ease of parking and getting around
we recently had two familyfriends that were extremely close with move to dc and its such a game changer having friends is nice but having family that we can drive a few minutes or take a scooter to go see is so hugemy wife and those friends that moved here are originally from the suburbs of philly but we definitely prefer dc as a city over philly but i think the friends and family factor would push me to philly in your case
ive lived in both and prefer dc any day super classy city  underrated night scene  i mean spring time is the best walking around dupont circle or u street getting a drink or coffee well dressed city so much to do when friends visit with the museums and monuments while i love philly for the people being super prideful about their city its a bit too rugged for my taste buildings too condensed i dont feel comfortable walking with a friend at night in certain neighborhoods even for something convenient like getting something from my car literally phillys pricing for rent is awesome better sports down than dc and has a great aura around it but dc wins easily my roommates have said the same
having lived in both my entire life the people in dc are wayyyyyy friendlier  i could easily start a conversation with a stranger here but in philly youll be told to fuck offonce you get out of philly its suburban hell in both nj and pa  within a  minute drive there isnt much to do other than go to king of prussia malldc is consistently rated number one for parks   you can disappear in rock creek park and roosevelt island and see deer and not even feel like youre in the cityphilly has some history but its pretty much just the liberty bell and the events around that  dc has sooo much variety in history cultures and food  philly has good food but not in the same way we have it here  they may have one or two pho places  we have  of them  there is a much broader variety of people as well  philly is relatively segregated and while there are other cultures its basically blackwhite  you at least if youre not from the culture have to search for it  here is everywhere   ive met someone from every country in africa for example  in jersey the whitest fuckers on the planet think being italian is ethnic never been to italy dont speak the language and maybe maybe their great great grandfather immigrated here from italyits not like that here at all  other than the interns on the hill that come here to make a difference before getting burnt out people here are pretty genuine authentic and friendlyin philly id consider it a good day if i managed to take a walk and not run into a homeless dude masturbating on the sidewalk
i moved here from philly for a job and honestly i still really miss it if i was able to choose to go back i probably would and i still really like dc of course its the first city i lived in postgrad and a bunch of my time in dc has been marred by the pandemic but still theres a lot of charm i miss and considering you already know a lot of people there that swings it even more in your favor that doesnt even touch the rent discrepancy though i guess i get paid more comparably its hard to telli will say that if you to decide to move to dc i doubt youll hate it but i just have such a soft spot in my heart for philly but it might help if you share what attracts you to dc over philly or vice versa
dc is way cleaner people from both cities tend to be abrasiverude unless you look like you belong in their social class philly has bangin food although dc has stepped it up big time over the past decade and outside of baltimore i wouldnt get seafood anywhere else both cities have the big four sports teams workwise both are major hubs for pretty much any industry you care to work in the opportunities are huge dcs only advantage comes in if youre in the political field wmata fucking blows septa is way better but all of my philly friends claim we have it good when they visit grass is greener i guess i liked phillys nightlife a lot dcs feels more pretentious but maybe thats because of where i go all in all neither are the best city in the world but id rather live in either than most other places
in a sentence dc is an easily walkable city with a million things to do for free
i love philly honestly id move there
i like how many people dress like theyre the main character in a john grisham novel
i really liked living in dc but honestly id choose philly if i had the choice between the two
if i worked remotely and didnt care about job market and all my friends and family lived in philly id go there  unless i was already from philly and young in which case id move somewhere else like abroad or the west coast  otherwise id choose dc arlington even though i also work remotely because its safer and cleaner with much better public transit  id rather live in a more democratic state dc va md with laws that better protect me as woman  the fact that phillypa still allows smoking and the sale of cigarettes in bars was actually a big factor in me deciding not to move there  i think it speaks volumes  oh and legalized marijuana in dc and va
deleted
i grew up around philly and ive been here for about  years im biased im very very biased i will get that out of the way right nowi would go to philly especially if you have friends and family there philly is the kind of town that is made x better by having friends and family even if its awesome on its own its also way cheaper and in my opinion has a much better food culture which is a thing for me idk about you people can fight me on that but ill take reading terminal or any hole in the wall cheesesteak place over the th ethiopian restaurant any day of the week additionally if you are a football or hockey fan philly is a much more fun place to be cost of living is way cheaper up there and the summersspring are not quite as brutalso yea admitting my own bias i would prefer philly over dc and if you have friends there i definitely suggest you go philly making friends as an adult is not easy i wont say philly is any better because ive never had that experience but it wasnt and continues to be difficult here although that might just be part of making friends as an adult being difficult in general
honestly if i was starting right from ground zero between dc and philly id pick philly its cheaper and closer to nyc what i like most about dc is the cast of interesting people ive met here but you can meet great people anywhere i had to move to dc for a job several years ago but have been staying around for the people
ive lived in both philly and dc although philly for years longer i miss the grit and downtoearthness of philly luckily the train ride is quick and easy to get up there  the drive can be trafficky and long at times the idea of homeownership is also something actually attainable in philadelphia philly also has a sense of community something i have not found here in dc most of my friends in philly own their places and it really is so nice to be able to walk a few blocks and pop in on your friends whether they like it or not the food scene is one of my favorite in the country as well and also affordable i miss phillyif i could move my job from dc to there i would
have not lived in philly but have family there and between that occasionally work and various other events ive been there a loti guess this is less selling you on dc and more well shitting on philly sorry phillydc is basically philly but clean dc has most of the conveniences of a big city without having to actually be in a big city its difficult to drive in dc its impossible in philly in either place you should get a bike though philly is dirtier philly has more and more aggressive homeless and for that matter hookers i cant remember the last time i saw a hooker in dc i was in philly a couple of months ago and decided to go for a walk around pm in gym shorts a tank top and sandals i apparently looked like i was looking for a good timeweve got historic buildings and you can actually tour pretty much any of them we have monuments we have parks we have the current goingson of democracy and we have sidewalks you can actually walk on and streets you can actually drive ondc has a certain indefinable quality if a thing is going to happen it will happen here there was recently this groundbreaking vr experience that only had about  locations across the country i believe there was one in nyc there was not one in philly they opened a storefront for it in dc not that dc is any bigger or wealthier than philly its just the place things happenpretty much any advantage philly might have dc has more you can find a place in one of our suburbs where the rent is much cheaper and still be a relatively quick metro ride from anything you might want to get to in the city granted out metro sucks but again ive been on mass transit in philly and as bad as dc is better than philly is a low bar to get overanyway sorry if i sound like a jackass harshing on philly its sorta my point though its not really that dc itself is especially amazing just that anything philly has dc has better
walkability
 convenience  it has pretty much everything other big cities have but in a condensed area thats incredibly walkable and bikeable  theres plenty to do and its often free theres constantly events going on on top of all the free sightseeing and museums all over the city cost of living is high going out is expensive but theres no lack of free or cheap entertainment  the people when im swiping on dating apps i like knowing theres a  chance everyone im looking at is well educated and liberalminded which are things i personally value
i havent been in philly for several years but when i visited that city just depressed me everything felt like it was  years behinddc is expensive but lots of job opportunities and modern conveniences virginia is a very well run state in particular compared to many with great schoolswhat career are you in keep in mind that a more expensive city isnt necessarily bad if it results in a much higher salary or better opportunities for you
i currently live in dc but im originally from the philly area and i lived there for most of my life overall i think dc is a nicer city there are some really nice areas in philly but it has a lot more rough areas than dc another pro for dc is that public transportation is way better for dc and the surrounding areas i also think theres a better job market in the dmv area but i guess that depends on what industry youre in the big pro for philly though is that the col is better it might not make a huge difference if youre renting but it definitely will if youre looking to buy a house a nice house in the philly suburbs would probably be like half the price of what it would be here
positives about dc amazing food and restaurant scene diverse communities and people culture museums monuments lots of great neighborhoods to choose from easy to navigate and get around multiple airports in the area for travel networking and job oportunities education maybe not dc proper but for most of the surrounding area plus many great higher ed institutions in case you want an advanced degree
havent lived in philly but actually just went there for the first time a few weeks ago after living in dc for  years i loved it dc is more transient many of the people you meet wont be from the area but it doesnt mean theyre not invested in the community the mixing of cultures makes dc really interesting and diverse if youre into exploring those sorts of thingsdc is not as much of a city as philly which could be a pro or a con for you im from the northeast and grew up outside of new york so my idea of a city was everything new york is hustle and bustle tall buildings dc feels like a faux city in comparison the height limit on buildings makes everything feel more livable but also much quieter at first i didnt like how certain neighborhoods or areas were so quiet on the weekends but ive grown to like that living here for a few years philly on the other hand felt much more like new york than dc when i was there a lot of the area around dc ishas been developed into suburban sprawl some of it feeling soulless at worst conventional at best much of it is nice but nothing special its something that keeps me from wanting to be here long term as i dont think i couldwould want to own in dc proper thats not to say places like alexandria arent beautiful and charming i dont know if i can really offer much more as i dont have too good of an understanding of specific philly culture to compare it to dc is a unique fun liveable city with a lot of  somethings dictating many of the things around you its expensive but theres things that cant be had in any other city like the museums and monuments and the people are generally wonderfuli want to add regardless of where you choose i hope you enjoy it and it works out for you

i dont know if its because people dress business casual more often or what but there are many good looking people
greenspace of dc is top quality we have the more tree strewn neighborhoods in mt pleasant and woodley park in my mind though the idea that we have basically a quarter of the city totally filled with a beautiful park that is under the jurisdiction of nps is outstanding rock creek park is the selling point of dc for me decent trails beautiful running and biking on beach creek picnic spots and historical sites at pierce mill alongside the park is direct access to the zoo which is so pretty and a lovely day out others have discussed the bikeability and such which is also huge i wish the buses ran on shorter intervals but the buses are excellent here and seemingly there are plans to make them betterits tough because it really is expensive but the access you here is better than philly with the added bonus of lots of free activities to enjoy and an ever improving food scene if i have one complaint aside from cost its that dc doesnt have that obvious weird quality of say philly or austin people here are smart type a folks theres a large lgbt populace but it doesnt translate into a hip art scene and such thats my opinionits also very clean here compared to philly or nyc
living in philly is better but the job market and pay in dc is better comes down to what youre looking for in a city dc has extremely unwelcoming locals its more spread out so it doesnt feel like a metropolis more museums in dc more trails in the area than philly worse drivers in dc crime seems to be the same although i think dc may have more shootings lately
get out and save your money
the better question is what you enjoy or would like to enjoy  what makes other people happy is irrelevant unless you plan on enjoying specific activities with the person try activities enjoyed by others or attempt to improve the quality of life in one of the cities i mean some enjoy horseback riding while others enjoy things like yoga news politics gaming having a family swimming wall climbing watching plays or concerts meetups jogging tennis going to bars watching comedies bowling watching movies going to sporting events having a pet travelling to other places etc
love dc and have been here for  years but in philly you will have a better quality of life for less  id say philly is a nobrainer both have great food culture diversity history art cute neighborhoods similar weather but philly is just cheaperone exception do you work in and are you passionate about politicspolicy if so dc is the place where you will can create a network of friends doing important political work in different areas government nonprofits consulting etc if your advocacy work is really really important to youinside and outside of workdc is obviously a much more political place if you volunteer on campaigns on the weekend are obsessed with fighting for climateracial justice etc and know every member of congress then you will fit in in dc if youre like a teacher or engineer or something and prefer not to talk about politics at all dc is not for you
dc is really walkable in a unique european way  philly suffers a little bit in that its broken up by odd pockets of bad sidewalks and is more spread outit will surprise you if you can manage to live inside the city core how clean walkable bike able and dense it is  rock creek park and the national mall are both really great green spaces   its a x mile square that is continuous wellmanaged urbanity and it has less hilliness than sf  the suburban minicities here like tysons corner or rockville have everything you can get in most mediumlarge american cities plus they are more diverse and educated if youre into that
neither  live in baltimore  cost of living is way cheaper and you are a  minute train ride from union station in dc
city itself is relatively small in area which makes it easy to get between neighborhoods and in some ways makes it feel like a big town and less like a big city because of federal government and the many nonprofit organizations based here the city is full of interesting smart people from around the country and the worldlots of interesting events all over the city all the time at least precovidlots of people visit dc so for many people their friends and family want to come visit often relatedly many people come here to work or for school for a few years or sometimes longer so you may have friends move nearby more often than if you lived in another less transient citywinters arent as bad as bigger cities further north in fact i think the only really negative thing about dc is how bad the summers get although at least we dont get smoke and forest fires like out westso much interesting history beautiful parks and monuments and free museums sometimes i lose interest in them because they are always around and i stop appreciating them but really there is always some place to go that is fun and interestingi guess this fits under beautiful parks but its worth its own bullet point rock creek park ive really started appreciating it more during the pandemic a lot of trails nice biking or walking on beach drive cool views from the bridges just really relaxing spot i dont know any other cities that have such a large park where you can honestly feel like you are miles away from the city although if you know of any id love to hear about them
if you live in or near dc proper then having  major airports all  hr give or take gives you great options on pricing and destination
i hate to say this but theres no rational reason to move here unless you really have to ie a career thing or you happen to just be a native its a great place to visit and thats doable from philly but everything is less for morehere housing parking dining out  of the metro trains are currently out of commission due to a detailing issue theres no quick way in or out something as simple as a trip to the store can consume a whole afternoon making friends and relationships is exponentially difficult i love the town please dont take his the wrong way but theres a reason people tend to notstay very long now for the positive tons of stuff to do all the time and much ofit free beautiful springs mild winters one of the most highly educated concentrations of people in the world which can cause feelingsof inadequacy for me anyway but wouldaligns with what your values seem to be lastly lots of great parks in and around the city and while virginia gets a negative stigmatization by dc residents for reasons i cant figure out it too has beautiful parks and vineyard country just anhour or so away
honestly center city philly is expensive as less desirable areas of dc but philadelphia is walkable and imo has better infrastructure and has a great live music scene and much cheaper to live in just saying
philly reminds me of a cross between boston and baltimore dc has a more buttonedup vibe   im from new england and have also lived in the midwest and west coast ive been in dc for over  years and like it well enough ive seen it change a ton im not sure what the situation with development is in philly but theres been a lot of fancy new buildings going up and wealthier people moving in neighborhoods many people never heard of years ago are now boomingh streetatlas district and union market are two key examples rent here is expensive but you can find some deals if you look closely act quickly and decide what tradeoffs youre willing to deal with i chose a building that is not terribly fancy so i could be close to the metro for instance   we have great museums here and many of them are free good restaurants lots of movie theatres plenty of bars if youre into sports dc has tons of intramural leagues you can survive without a car here rock creek park is great for nature strolls   i am not too familiar with the restaurant scene in philly but i agree their dim sum is way better as others have noted the better chinese restaurants in the area are in the suburbs
my cars battery is dead and i dont care because i walk or bike everywhere
im currently interviewing for a job in dc and a job in philly so hopefully in the next week or so ill be in a somewhat similar situation its definitely a tough choice but the col is definitely pulling me towards philly if given the choice
having been in both and moving back to philly after  years here dc is great for a short stint its not the kind of place you stay permanently imo generally i dont find people as friendly relationships dont last as its very transient and the traffic fucking sucks so be ready to live somewhere along a metro or within a short commute that said its a great place still it has great walkable areas particularly if you live downtown the food and drink scene is diverse and interesting there is a ton of wealth here as well streets are much cleaner a lot of free things to do too the drive back to philly isnt too bad either gets old after a while with about  in tolls im from the nj side of the river so slightly less for you with all thats happened with covid tho im opting out and heading to the philly suburbs
i think philly is a cool city to live when you are younger but that city is too old rugged and gives me the dirty vibes what value is there to gain from living there besides affordable rent
so im a washingtonian thrown through ive lived in dc my whole life other than when i went to college which was only at a school in maryland not far away but one of the best things about living in washington dc is that you can get around everywhere by mattara but thats the same in philly i feel as though in washington dc there are a lot of events that are always happening and if you are into politics this is the place to be and rock creek park is one of the most beautiful places to enjoy the nature in washington dc is the fittest city in the nation too i live in tenlytown but think adams morgan is one of the funniest places to hang out i went to school with the duggans who owns madam morgan one of the best known bars in dc but the warf is a good spot to hang out
not going to try and sell you dont care you do what you want they are two and half hours away from each other if you cant be bothered to experience both am just going to publicly pity you missing out on  great citys
its a classy place to live
having sex with different races of women particularly white and latina women
meh fuck dc expensive cramped performative swampy enjoy better qol elsewhere
we have incredible food from all over the world but a big chunk of it is in the burbs
all the universities are great  the presence of georgetown and george mason especially inject muchneeded virility into the downtown culture
leaving
dc has gotten really ghetto since the defund the police movement i hear gunshots every week in previously safeish areas
more out of towners need to move out
my vote try out dc and youre only  hours by train from philly so easy to get home to see friends and family but far enough away to prevent dropbys
dc is fantastic great diversity in the people and the food you can find food from literally any corner of the world around here sure rent is high but it just is what it is when you want to live in a metropolitan city
philly is a very rugged ugly looking city dc is beautiful and cleaner however you will probably get more bang for your buck in philly
you see all the things that make our nations capital a special place to live so if you can afford it come to dc  if youre able to live in a nice building in a nice neighborhood and not have to be overly concerned about daily expenses then i think youd have a great experience living in dc
it has  seasons
this is a pro for me at least it seems like everyone in philly is into philly sports there are more diversity in term of interests in dc
weather i hope to never again endure a buffalo ny winter 
the relaxed cannabis laws
dc has an amazing restaurant and bar culture so many neat hidden gems and new places opening i really enjoy trying new places
its always sunny in philadelphia
now that a year has gone by are you glad you decided to live in philly at least at first and do you still plan to go to dcnovai am going through the same exact dilemma at the moment with work offering me to live in either area family in the philly area but dcnova looks like it could be a good opportunity and looks nice thanksxb edited for spelling corrections
 for this reply i know its a bit ironic to say this at the moment but i find it very easy to be carfree here i also love how beautiful dc is and its clean too
public transportation in san francisco is better tho
 this  as you said i think it depends on your priorities and interests i loved living in dc and miss it now that im away  i made philly work but never really liked it the same way i have friends who are the exact oppositebut i value things like museums safety green space diversity people  food educated population etc more and they value sports longevity of relationships bc people dont move consistency one specific culture more neither one is better just better fit for the person
 i feel like less of an outsider here because so few of the people i work with and have become friends with are from herei agree with what you said but want to point out that in reality people from dc do exist but exist almost entirely in different social circles from people who move here from elsewhere im not talking just about classracial divides though they obviously exist and contribute to this i feel this is worth pointing out because new arrivals like op can easily get the impression that no one is from dc and that attitude can have a negative downstream impact i dont think thats what you were trying to say just wanted to clarify for op
 this is a good point about rent compression as tier  cities have increased rent it actually makes tier  cities more logical sine you get a lot more for just a bit more moneybuying re is a different thing though
mostly agreeing but disagree on food it depends what type of food but the asian food korean indian chinese thai and vietnamese etc are x better in the dc area vs the philly area but the cheesesteaks here suck
 my salary in philly topped out at k ive more than doubled my salary since movingthats a pretty big bump  for reference what do you do or what field do you work in
re money  also keep in mind that what really matters is not percentages but the absolute amount left after expenses if you make twice as much and your cost of living is twice as high youre definitely better off because that means your savings and fun money are also doubled even if you have to go from spending  on rent to  meaning that your rent more than quadrupled that would still be an improvement since the remaining  of your new salary is more than  of your old one
 agree about the job opportunities  it depends on your field but almost all of the large tech companies have a footprint in northern va
this is a great reply thanks some of the woes you mention about philly i am experiencing in miami where im from do you mind how i asked how you managed to get a job in dc asking for myself managed to get an interview up there but have been striking out a lot
i appreciate the honesty this is exactly what i needed to hear because you are completely right thank you 
if it werent for philly sports fans i would agree with you although ive never lived there every visit was great
id do the same my wife agrees too
yeah dc is great but why not live near friends and family
this is the best response so far have spent tons of time in both cities and your comment is spot on hope op sees it
thats a great idea and along the lines of what ive been thinking as well my company is headquartered right outside of dc so although im remote a lot of people live in the area and itd definitely be easier to network like you said if i was in dc living in philly might be better for a year or so to save money though thank you 
""
 the weather is much better dc summer is hot but its not texas hot dc is humid for sure but there were cool days here in the summer that i didnt get before fall weather has been amazing so farah so you havent gone through our winter i think youll be singing a different tune by february 
whereabouts in texas did you move from  im making that transition myself currently
fifty bbq in hyattsville md have a popup in union market as someone who livedspent tons of time in austin i can tell you this will fit the bill salvadoran couple from central tx and they do no electric smoke in a  gallon offset smoker now if we could just get the tex mex 
if you havent gone to cactus cantina you need to try it out best texmex in the city
i think you meant move not mice
 well dressed cityhavent heard people call dc that before
i dont have the stats in my back pocket and i live in a established neighborhood but ive always felt safer in dc never worried about running a late night errand with my headphones on or showing my friends around at night i lived in west philly in a bad neighborhood and i always felt like i had be on alert and act like a regular so i dont get messed with
do you feel more comfortable  safe in dc i know that both are cities and are each going to be unsafe to some degree but im curious if dc is considerably safer or not
would love to know what neighborhood you lived in in philly if you dont mind sharing and what it is you miss about living there itd be great to hear your perspective on the city  also would like to know your thoughts on how safety compares in philly vs dc
i grew up in philly riding septa and when wmata has its shit together i think its better
curious where you go for nightlife that feels pretentious
thats a very accurate description of philly
curious what neighborhood did you see hookers in philly i never seen any in the  years ive lived here but i saw a handful in thomas circle in dc a few years ago pretty sure hookers exist in every city in the countryalso are you implying that philly doesnt have historic buildings or sidewalks 
oh man we left dc for portland in  and i tell ya going to their art museum after  years of free smithsonians everywhere was the absolute saddest thing
but then you need to live in baltimore you know why its cheap right barely any grocery stores and tons of crime even moreso than dc
so does philly and its cheaper too
george mason is in fairfax not downtown
philly is known for its university footprint philly has penn drexel and usciences in university city thomas jefferson in old city and temple in north philly thats just inside the actual city  expand to the suburbs and theres a ton more if you want to live somewhere thats a hub for academia id pick philly over dc
did you mean george washington university gwu
virilitydowntown
it has  seasons but two of them are five months each and the other two are a month each
well hopefully mr putin will melt it soon
the asian food korean indian chinese thai and vietnamese etc are x better in the dc area vs the philly area emphasis on area though i disagree about chinese i dont drive and think its easier to get to quality vietnamese and chinese food from center city than it is to get to annandale eden center or the other suburban areas with good asian food
i disagree on the chinese food especially authentic chinese food philly has a real chinatown dc does not phillys chinatown gives you a similar vibe to nycflushingsf just not on the same size and scale the good chinese restaurants in the dmv are in rockville and theyre not really concentrated in philly you can get go to chinatown get dim sum stop by a chinese bakery buy some vegetables get some matcha ice cream all within  city block if you wanted to cant do that in rockville without a car and the dc gallery place is really chinatown in name only
theres no good pizza in dc either or deli
agree to disagree on the food i havent found a place in dc that comes even close to vietnam cafe in west philly cant speak to the cheesesteaks though ive never had one
as someone who as also lived in both philly and dc the foodie scene is miles better in philly than dc dc does not have the density of amazing affordablecheap foods as philly does even on the higher end of restaurants they are better ive felt like in dc you really have to find hidden gems but in philly nothing is a hidden gem almost everything is amazing i think this is a common sentiment among those who have lived in both cities the food scene just not the same level in dc as it is in philly
im a salesforce consultant but in philly i had to settle for a salesforce admin job in dc theres a huge market for consultants because of all the federal contracts to be clear the first job i accepted here in dc was for k but over the last  years with subsequent moves its gone past the k threshold
tbh in my field salesforce consulting the recruiters come to me all the nonprofitsngos use salesforce as their crm and half the federal government uses highly customized instances of salesforce for their business processes i just set my linkedin profile as open to recruiters and respond to the ones with interesting offers
i have lived in the dc area pretty much my whole life and in dc proper for a good chunk of that my dad is from philly i went to hs outside of it philly is a lovely city with a lot of culture tons of history and lots of stuff going on the people are great and honestly its a pretty awesome place i love dc its absolutely my home but if i could make comparable money there and my wife was also into the idea i would be very tempted to movephilly in general has a better restaurant scene than dc and its a lot cheaper overall
im a snow scientist so im somewhat used to the cold due to field work in much colder places  i hated not having cold ever in texas so well see  it might still be too cold for me though
our winters are pretty soft as it goes this side of the us tbh even for a southern transplant
i think ive seen you in the aggies sub  i moved from bcs  i was there for grad school finishing writing remotely
yeah ive been meaning to try that place  i saw it on a list  thanks for the heads up
have not  will try ty
for sure haha i was still halfasleep typing that comment
as somebody that lived in the south and west for a while dc is truly a very welldressed city yes the bar is low and it doesnt compare to european cities but its nice to see people walking in bizcaz on a saturday
people definitely dress up more here than other places ive lived although more just the business look rather than glamorous or anythingi moved here from california to teach at a university and its nuts how much people dress up for everyday things compared to what i was used to a typical prof where i came from would wear a tshirt to class esp if it was a sciencemath prof now i have students who wear a suittie or a dress to class i had to start wearing buttondown shirts to teach so i wouldnt feel outdressed by undergrads
lots of people in suits and business casual mf
i think it all depends on where you are in the city although from my understanding philly is on the higher side for crime of major cities within the us
i lived in italian market which i loved i miss the costs for sure rents an easy one but also smaller things like gyms were cheaper i think that safety is a similar issue in both places things like shootings and rogue dirt bikes are prevalent in both but i can list some pro vs cons for phillypros smaller feeling more easily walkable less of a transient culture that obviously i am part of better food scene imo though dcs is fine different neighborhoods have distinct charm so you can choose the one that works best for you easier access to nycnortheast in general better housing marketcons the small oneway streets can get really annoyingclaustrophobic not as easy to access a wider variety of nature depending on where you live you may have to rely on busses more than subway trash situation is a bit wonkyagain theyre both good i like living in dc but i just love philly
 when wmata has its shit together  rare but fair
pretty much any cocktail bar or speakeasy same happens at less fancy places like the hamilton or the occidental too though it may be because i dont look like i have money and im young ergo no tip but i never get served and i get generally disapproving looks from other patrons
i was staying at rittenhouse at the time and saw two possibly three one of them wasnt totally cleari last saw hookers in dc about   years agoi was trying to go for like here are the things we have in common as in one of phillys claims to fame is things like the historic buildings and sites and various then in contrast we have sidewalks that are more than two and a half feet wide so you can actually use them for walking purposes because by and large philly does not have that
ngl i didnt read the post
across the river
chinatown in dc was real until it became gentrified it still has a few authentic chinese food places though i think anyway been over  years since i stopped there
i always wondered this i havent found a good chinese food place either but will def check out rockville on the weekend i do have to say the best alternative ive found in dc is chiko their orange chicken dry rub wings and butter rice are pretty darn good
i grew up in the dmv and am confident in saying there is no way the chinese food in dc is better than philly dc or more like annandale has better korean food than philly however rockville gaithersburg silver spring has decent chinese philly cant hold a candle to dc these days but food is where it outshines the nations capital and the surrounding burbs
we have good pizza now we dont have great sandwich shops that ill grant you there are like  good cheesesteaks in the tri state
erroneous erroneous on both countshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzbbxzogek pupatella call your mother
get over to the eden center in  corners va asap best vietnamese food in the us outside of the oc and on par with houston
as a salesforce admin becoming a developer hopefully by  the end of this year this makes me happy mind if i ask how you got into a consultant gig there are always recruiters dropping into my linkedin dms but i do feel like the recruiters dont really know what the job is asking for
sorry for the delay but thank you
you were a snow scientist in texas ok thats a little funny
the winters really arent too bad you get some snow but there are plenty of mild days peppered in always a stretch or two of days in ss in decjan and you tend to avoid the deep punishing cold of the rest of the northeast
small world  havent been active in raggies in a hot minute lol
dc is well dressed in that people are often in nice clothes dc is not a stylish or trendy city as far as the average dresser goes
one of my friends who visited and rode the metro at rush hour said its the first time theyve ever felt underdressed on public transport
right not sure i know a dangerous neighbored except  in northeast dc but really philly is its own beast when it comes to how tough the people are ive been in compton tijuana southside chicago and nothing struck me as more rugged and tough than philly
based on what dc has a higher murder rate source httpswwwcbsnewscompicturesmurdermapdeadliestuscities
right an hour by metro and  minutes by car  definitely contributing to the virility of downtown why not just say oops i meant george washington instead of doubling down on mason lol really not a big deal just sort of amusing  makes me think you havent actually spent much time in dc
yep the real chinese joints arent in chinatown in dc
it wasnt much when i moved here  years ago people tell me it was good in the s and s
we have good pizza now i beg to differ
ill call my mom and ask her to send me some decent pizza and a corned beef special
were talking philly vs dc not suburbs
just reach out to recruiters at any of the firms around here if youre already an admin with a cert or two youre likely to get hired as a ba
haha yeah i get that reaction a lot  as an aside i have two cats  one is named falafel the other is named waffles  your name really amused me
i go in occasionally out of habit but i dont post often  a lot of my aggie cohort ended up here in the dmv theres a lot of us around here but i suppose thats true of most big cities
agree
its become more so over the last decade or so
i agree with this one ive moved to miami now and ive loved seeing how wild people dress here especially for nightlife absolutely my cup of tea stylewise   like you say ive noticed people in dc dress well but in very classic understated styles
this kinda blows my mind lol i live in se across the river and apart from date nights in the mainland i dont see this at all people here are really dressed down
deleted
have you been to baltimore
lol ever been to se east of the river you have to be trolling
benefit of the doubt maybe theyre talking about the virginia square campus a lot of grad students at gmu who have dcy jobs probably have their programs there rather than main campus
george mason has the virginia square campus  gw is cool though tooi was just giving two examples of unis
im a new yorker and ive lived in dc for  years now and ive just given up trying to compare pizzasbagels in dc to ny however andys in shaw has some damn good pizza thats quite comparable to ny in my opinion closest thing youll get to a traditional ny style slice
i like all purpose wiseguys little cocos sonnys underground pizza co timber we may not have a great slice shop in every neighborhood but there are a ton of good options
only because you arbitrarily decided to impose that geographical limitation eden center is squarely within the dc area and in fact the person you agreed to disagree with specifically said the dc area asian food korean indian chinese thai and vietnamese etc are x better in the dc area vs the philly areatheres absolutely no reason to limit yourself to the geographical borders its a hell of a lot easier for someone in georgetown to get to the eden center than it would be for someone in somerton to get to eastwick despite both those neighborhoods being within phillys city limits
lol
lol falls church is almost in the original dc square i refuse to allow for the loss of arlington to va due to the fact that they wanted to keep trading slaves say otherwise
haha i love that
maybe ill start wearing my ring again and get it resized finally lol
this is so good to know as an aggie looking for a future home after graduation
style  costyou can have great timeless style from thrifting alone why are you so hostile its a beautiful day go outside
i havent been only lived here a year pretty naive to the area
philly is one of the most populated cities in the country  million people completely different scale
perhaps  still not downtown though so a bit off nonetheless not a big deal just a weird example
this
i agree but its too crunchy
philly has it all over dc pizza wise
we may not have a great slice shop in every neighborhood but there are a ton of good optionsi think its consistency and price the best pizza in dc is pretty good but you need to know where to get good pizza and you pay for the quality its really good though
i didnt arbitrarily decide anything the op asked about living specifically in dc not dmvnova area compared to philly i was responding to the ops question
i mean philly might be twice as big but  isnt something i would consider small crime rate wise both cities are almost identical though i think dcs is a bit higher this is the way i always compare the neighborhoods by their similarity when someone asks me ward  in dc is like the troubled parts of north philly ward  is like sw philly ward  is like the southern part of north philly ward  is west philly ward  is ne philly ward  is nw philly ward  is center city and ward  is south philly one of the major difference though is that except for black people in dc everyone else seems to be a transplant whilst in philly they are real ass locals
id rather have mine be a bit too crunchy than mushy and doughey but its all personal preference in the end
yeah im honestly a little butt hurt about how expensive good pizza is sonnys was ridiculous
theyre very clearly asking about living in the dc area if something is just as easy to get to in the dc metro area as it would be in the philadelphia metro area then theyre going to want to know about it
i get that whats great about philly is you have the option to get it either way theres not just one place in the entire city
ive really only been to philly once but i want to visit again some point soon i meant with amtrak i really should get up there
what part of dc do you live in  for being such a small city dc has a lot of pockets and neighborhood differences can be stark  for example takoma has much different vibes than ad mo which has much different vibes then downtown or even mt pleasant  maybe check out eastern market on a weekend day not just the market but the surrounding areas too  and figure out what you liked about london  dc is no london but neither is any other us city
if youve been getting the feels from baltimore maybe you would enjoy hanging out in the northeast part of the city more i grew up in a nonchicago great lakes city and besides just taking the occasional day trip to baltimore brookland and the nearby neighborhoods definitely feel the most homelike my version of a real city would add the georgia ave corridor through maryland silver springwheaton not like olney as well
your post makes me wonder to what degree our perceptions of cities are influenced by our state of mind beforewhile moving there for example sf was the first city i moved to after leaving my small hometown and i was in love with everything about it rose colored glasses effect when i visit now it doesnt hit nearly the same way moving from london to dc is arguably a downgrade in a lot of ways and i say this as someone who loves dc and i wonder if this is subconsciously affecting your feelings about it after living in so many cities i feel like they are rorschach tests that reflect aspects of ourselves back at us or maybe its just not a match
i wonder if the sentiment of dc feeling soulless or missing the it factor despite the abundance of cultural institutions diversity landscapes etc is that its a relatively small city with a huge amount of tourism so much of the culture feels like its not for us
i think we invest too much in the cities we live in personally like why do so many people make the city they live in core to their identity i say that as someone who loved dc and lived there for a decade i just left and it was definitely a big part of my identityto a certain degree though a city is what you make of it your network your routines your home etc dc is pretty livable insofar as its very walkable easy enough to get around lots to do etc so it is what you make of it if you have a job you love and a network of social connections you can really love anywhereedit my point is really invest in those things social connections your home routines that bring you joy and youre likely to love it here or anywhere else
move back to baltimore or move to philly its cool not everybody likes every place
it took me a good year or so to really love dc part of the problem was that the first place i lived was this mega apartment complex in falls church so even though i was spending  hours a day in dc i wasnt really able to fully immerse myself in it moved to dupont then later petworth and everything changed plus lots of people i know who moved to new cities during the pandemic had a harder time getting to know themalso you say that it feels flat and like a hollywood city set have you ever read up on the history of dc not the political aspects but the communities and people and outsideofcapitolhill stuff theres such a rich culture when we were new there my husband and i used to pick a new random neighborhood to read up on and explore each weekend we had this book that would point out culturally significant spots made me appreciate dc as a city apart from the nations capital im in a new city now that i love but man nothing will ever replace that energy that dc gave me of course it could just be that its not for you which is totally ok philly and baltimore are also great
youre living in a city that still hasnt bounced back to anywhere close to where it was before the pandemic thats going to be true in every major city right now it takes years for the cultural heart of a city to recover
sounds like a depression problem not a city problem went through that in boston during college myself i wish i had done therapy then it wouldnt have prevented me from coming home after college because i work in a very niche part of my field but i would have struggled less in college
large parts of dc are populated largely by young people who bring money into the city but wont be staying for long that leads to a kind of shallowness imo the establishments that tend to be most profitable in these areas dont have much of a neighborhood feel because most of the people they cater to arent going to be around for longthere are good spots though mt pleasant is a favorite neighborhood of mine my spirits lift every time i go there
dc isnt london however the last year and a  has not been representative of what dc can offer i have left and come back twice now each time it took me a while to find a group of  friends   goes to show just how transient this city is
ive lived in london dc and philly among other places and i see what you mean i still visit baltimore and go back to philly regularly because they have a closer feel citywide to what youre describing
so i just went through almost the exact situation as you described but my move was from another state to dc all i can say is that you need to separate the city from yourself all this means is that you have probably been through a lot a change in scenery is nice but wont bring you the happiness your looking for we have to work on ourselves and by doing that youll likely start enjoying the city for what it is i always compare it to the happiest moments in life typically if i look back most of those moments are a mix of the right people place and mindset
 relate dont think ill ever love a city as much as i loved london 
i think thats fine and understandable ive lived in dc for  years and love it here i think it gets a bad rap but not every place is for everyone and thats finehave you found a group to join i have a few social groups in the city and i have found that it has made it loads better its not work related at all and doesnt involve going to a baralso i think a lot of people dont realize there is a washington and a dc and they are very different unfortunately a lot of stuff in dc is racialized and no offense to anyone but usually its white people complaining there is no character to the city when there is plenty its just you have to look for it outside of your comfort zone have you been to a gogo concert or a festivali hope things work out for you its tough to be in the position you are in
i understand what you mean im a transplant too and it doesnt really have that city charm in my opinion that i get from sf ny or london dc is really clean and nice but for me it just seems like it lacks culture
ive been here for over a decade have had similar thoughts to you kept thinking it would get better but it doesnt cut and run
it took me a few years yep had depression during them still do to love dc still not sure im there yet but it has grown on me since moving keep trying keep finding charms  museums events we get most of the big artists and musicals speakeasies and that friends and family will love to visit the capital  theres a lot to like and develop love for over time youve got this
ive found living in dc to be mehthere is some decent food some fun things to do and the city infrastructure is just a chaotic mess with no hope of ever actually fixing it given the current government architecture maybe if dc became a state the latter could be fixedthere are a few people ive met who love dc but can never actually explain why beyond its just the vibes those people have also never lived in a bigger city near a bigger city sure but i lived in the suburbs of boston is different than being in boston just like living in annandale is different than dci think the general vibe of people who love it are from people recently out of college who are spending their first time in a big city and exploring who they are they figure it out then they leave to do whatever they are actually doing with their lives the people who stay are then usually in the government complex and that leads to a very homogeneous culture because it takes a certain mindset to last thereim doing my best to enjoy it while im here pay way too much for way too little compared to a city like chicago and will eventually be able to leave and go enjoy living in a city better supportive of my interests and without the sway of the governmentalso the fact ted cruz has anything to do with governing my life when i cant vote for my own representatives is total bullshit
bit of the opposite for me so i guess it just comes down to individual preferences in the end used to be here but moved to london back in dc for christmas london is great but i just cant love it and walking around dc last night just felt so comfortable and nice to me the only thing i miss about london is the transit system
i think the answer is clearly more soulless navy yardesque cookie cutter condos that look exactly the same from omaha nebraska to raleigh north carolina to boise idaho
i break a lot of my life down to set and setting ie my frame of mind and the environment that i am in you sound lonely i get it i could feel lonely too but i choose to look at is as freedom free do do what i want all of the time pick a person in your head that appeals to you celebrity the person next door anyone that is positive now imagine a day out in the city with said person doing things that bring you joy georgetown a walk on the mall a museum dancing on the upper level at wonderland ballroom hoping that the bowing floor doesnt collapsedid you smile theres a start now just keep going with it seasonal depression is a thing my side gig is driving a few hours a month for uber and lyft i get all walks of life in and out of my car it usually gives me a pretty good pulse on the city i dont do it for the money its my form of social interaction should someone wish to talk to me i consider it meeting cool people  minutes at a time my only goal is for them to be in a better mood when they get out of my car than when they got in with that said i will leave you with this virtual gift this is a very special gift that you can never see the reason that its so special its just for you from me whenever you are lonely or even feeling blue you only have to hold this gift and know i think of you you never can unwrap it please leave the ribbon tied just hold this gift close to your heart its filled with love insideunknownwishing you all the best starting now 
dc has a very move for work career focused vibe or a dont yuppie my neighborhood vibe with sometimes little in between if you loved london you might fit better in brooklyn or other parts of nyc its very likely your job has a new york office
could be a bunch of things here maybe you need to spend some time learning about the history of the area lots of neighborhoods have rich and layered histories and i find that learning them makes me feel like im part of that narrative today regarding your idea that dc is kinda fake and like a movie set  yes that was my thesis in architecture school and its something every city does to an extent but especially capital cities lots to learn and look at but i think if you see through the history of it and understand it even critique it rather than take it at face value theres a lot to love about this city even though its far from perfect it has an identity though it can be hard to tease out between the politics focus on transplants etc that dominates the way we talk about it
hi i moved here after living in london for  years similarly i loved london and adjusting to being back in the us and dc was rough i guess i just sort of found things about dc that made me happy the thing that drove me out of london was just how hard it was to live there and i appreciate being able to afford more here in dc one bit of advice is to actively pursue your interests here i took up story telling with some classes at story district for example and sort of felt like i was meeting people and doing something cool
i completely understand what youre saying  lived in similar places and experienced a similar feelings my suggestion is to move to another place that gives you the feels and keep working on your mental health and wellbeing you dont need to stay in dc just because it sounds good on paper objectively has the features you like
if you still feel like bmore philly and the outskirts of sf feel more city than dcidk what to say but i do know a few people who have moved back here after living in london and amsterdam and compared to those its the actual dc streets well really just american streets but dc streets are relatively broad that make it feel less lived in
i know what your saying when i went to philly to visit my friend it felt more like a real city than dc or baltimore i think it has something to do with where people grow up and how people think the grass is greener on the other side depending on where we live it all comes down to making the most of any opportunity dc definitely has an international presence and vibe to it but i get what you mean about how phony and flat things feel at times depending on which part of dc your in at times it feels too pretentious and manufactured similar to how i feel about nova this city could definitely use more culture and have less people living in the same thought bubbles
i think a lot of people who move to certain cities slowly dilute the culture and change the city to soulless landscapes san francisco people move places change them to their liking and become upset that the place isnt cool anymore obviously an individual cant do that but gentrification is like a bacteria u need some and the right amount get too much or the wrong kind and everything goes to crap
you are not going to like every place and thats ok
hanging with the nonpolitics people and in the more nonpolitical areas of the city makes a big difference a lot more real local culture and less of that fake feeling not sure where you live but try to get away from navy yard wharf mvt downtown and look at other neighborhoods
fwiw ive lived in a lot of places la ny a few major cities in europe latin america india etc and this is probably my least favorite city for the exact reasons you mention i love rock creek park the neighborhoods are pretty its bikeable etc but it just feels shallow and or presentational i also feel its an uptight city meaning people are more likely to get upset over trivial things that dont impact them which makes the city unusually tense whenever im back in ny or london etc it wakes me up and im so much more engaged with the city i honestly think its the people even though we have a good community of friends here i often use the word flavorless to define the place its wellplated just not a lot of flavor
i absolutely agree have lived here for years and i love the people and the beautiful rowhomes and walkability but dc does not feel like a real city it lacks any and all chaotic energy the national mall is sterile and boring some people love how clean and orderly it is here feels soulless to me
you are correct dc is emotionally flat vanilla bland lacking a soul truth is no one lives here anymore  thats the issue its full if commuters never leaving their mark i recommend exploring other cities even the ones you mentioned before committing to going back overseas also yes to therapy i am currently living in baltimore hate it but spent all of my adulthood so far in philly  i miss it terribly
i think people are probably right that it may be mostly a therapy problem but dc is kind of flat city generally lots of type a ambitious weirdo people very transient  year olds doing their time then moving where they actually want to very touristy weird racial dynamics but hey thats most cities in the usa say this as a year resident thats fairly happy here
never related to anything more in my life
the only place that gives me the feels you describe is old town alexandria dc feels very sterile
id describe dc as being aesthetically and socially very refined in my opinion the people who tend to be attracted to dc are fairly flat as you say theyre living their life the way youre supposed to  they make good decisions they went to the right school they have a good job but they arent particularly unique the sort of people who mostly adhere to the status quo i would call them boringsterile safe mild mannered dc i think is a great place to live if you want to live in a city that doesnt have the chaos unpredictability and variability of most big cities and it begins to feel small very quickly or just if you like living in cities but wanna take a breather for a few years but not everyone sees it this way although to some extent in my opinion the people who respond to this characterization with idk what youre talking about thats not my experience at all tend to be but are not always the norm im talking about i know this is a fairly negative characterization but few places are objectively good or bad this is just the other side of the coin to those who speak positively about it sorta just a different view of the same things many like about dc
your first mistake was thinking dc would be anything remotely similar to london
op its the gentrification baby  dc truly lost its soul when they started to only focus on those making hella money when i moved to dc from ny in  i specifically remember how i felt a certain level of soul in dc that i didnt even feel in nyc but then the luxury buildings starting replacing every empty space in the city when govnt should have just focused on keeping dc livable for all folksbecause this is what truly makes a city its a damn shame
you know what they say  you cant run away from your problemsmoving again isnt going to help  start working out  go talk to a therapist if thats your thing  take a social media break  something is keeping you in a fog and its not foggy bottom
idk ive spent time in london and would say its one of my least favorite cities i dont like giant cosmopolitan cities like nyc or milan london weather depressed me and few things felt genuine people just find their people and their vibes and excitement in different things and i think its fine if this place doesnt suit your preferences start looking at options to move to baltimore or philly or maybe nyc
few places in the world are london the only place that really competes in the us is nyc as you mentioned baltimore sf chicago la and to a lesser extent boston will have a decent portion of it but dc is an oddity the population is largely transitory with fewer people having been here a long time those that have been in the area for a long time are often from outside in the suburbs a lot of the attractions are really built for and focused on tourists from museums to restaurants to food carts they target people that will come into town once and never come back museums theaters and higher end restaurants will work for good reviews and rely on reputation to get people in the door while cheaper restaurants and food trucks can make money just by being there and overcharging tourists that will be upset but never come back againthat said with any city living in it isnt about the city its about the community if youre not  settled try different neighborhoods to see if you find a better community also find what you are interested in im still very much missing my little neighborhood in nyc but the area i find the most comfort from in the dc area is the music scene so there are a lot of shows i go tobut if you dont find what you want in the dc area its easy enough to commute to from baltimore many people do
i never vibed with dcit definitely has great features but something was lost on me tooit started really bothering when i traveled anywhere else i felt alive like i was breathing pure oxygen  ive lived several places and enjoyed travel but never like thati dont want to shit on dc because there are so many great things about it and its full of interesting people  it was like being married to a model that i couldnt talk myself into being in love with
i know im late but this resonated with me and thought id chime in i lived in dc for a few years fell in love with it planned to move to london life dream but then covid hit and now im elsewhere very much struggling with depression about not being where i want to bedefinitely a good topic for counseling also others may be right about dc not being a fit for you might i throw in another hypothesis  life stage you loved london and other cities youve lived in up until now could this be the product of a different life stage making us im also  feel differently about places i wonder if well ever be able to feel the same about a place as we did in our s
 i can feel the soul of the city i think dc has lost a lot of its soul its more expensive more transient more important though are the people you get to know make some friends and then see how you feel
youre not alone ive been in dc for  years off and on first visited as a middle schooler in   its a love hate relationship for me
god damn some of yall need to pack up and move if you just constantly hate living here
wonder if youre just still a little depressed loving a city is about loving the people and things you do there as much as the place you had a seemingly great life and a relationship maybe you were doing things that made you happy you could see a longterm future there a change of place was probably important but id start by focusing on finding people and activities that make you happy
dc cultivates a very transactional culture as well i find that sometimes people just talk to me as a stepping stone to what they really want ive found valuable connections are really hard in dc especially for younger people who may not have their emotions and wants fully figured out ive never been demanded to do things or be a certain way anywhere elsejust in dc it feels like a chess game every time i go on a date i dont trust dc dating on the dating apps because of this obviously this isnt the same experience for everyone but as a young adult woman studying and working in the political science fields everything everyday feels transactional even the sexedit very important to note that im talking about people who moved to dc not the native dc population dc people that grew up in the city are some of the coolest people on earth
sounds like you should talk to a therapist
do you have friendscommunity here that makes the difference
because london is better
ive lived here for  years and had my ups and downs with mental health ive found my happiness here but can say that this city lacks character compared to philly richmond or baltimore there is very little room for fringe interests here
have you found enough community spots to give it that feel the smithsonian georgetown hiking etc are lovely but wont give you that feel youre looking for i feel like you have to do a bit more work to make dc feel neighborhoody than you would have in baltimore or london i also love london and baltimore and i understand what youre saying i do love dc but i had to really get to know it first before i had that feeling of  it helps that im also from the dmv but only moved to dc proper after college my issue is that all my friends left dc so im having to start from scratch at  years old for a local friend group 
i dunno if it makes you unhappy you dont have to have a reason i personally hate san francisco but every person i tell this to is shocked but i like dcit has lots of diversity places to go interesting people i dont mind the weather im from the great lakes region
i have had the exact same experience living in this city its such a sterile place it feels completely soulless to me as well having lived in other large cities dc is undoubtedly my least favorite for me the main thing missing here is real culture of course there are amazing museums that i do genuinely love here but that is manufactured and curated culture you go out in other cities  they feel alive the young people and everyone for that matter are painting and drawing and designing and dressing weirdly and just genuinely doing really cool  interesting stuff it feels like there is not any artistic scene here at all ik there are artists here ofc but nothing feels unique at all  for me that just makes the whole place seem flat  boring
its probably because despite all of the cool restaurants and shopping and such the gentrification sucked all the culture that wasnt foodie tourist or aloof yuppie
americans who lived short term abroad complaining that dc isnt europe are the worst
its a fake place too many people pretend they care and they just dont thats not to say there are good people here  there are but when i moved here and i asked someone how they liked the neighborhood and the reply was sorry i dont have any money that sticks to you and i dont think its the peoples fault completely either i think its a systemic failure of city policy and departmental arrogance towards things like homelessness and unemployment
a lot of dcs neighborhood centers lack some desirable traits that i think a lot of other big cities have more of  narrow streets with limited traffic mature trees views dc is flatno skylinelimited waterfront the industries here are also not creative and i think that impacts everything  food fashion behavior havent been in awhile but blagden alley and th st nw and park used to be two nooks i really liked to find a spot for a coffee or cocktail and people watch
ive been here about a year and a half as well and i also struggle granted i came here for law school which doesnt give me much personal time to explore lived in chicago paris france san diego asheville nc and now here its ten times better here than north carolina for me but this city still doesnt feel like home everything is outrageously priced the humidity and mosquitoes are unbearable there is so much crime drivers acting like they want to murder you and people are friendly yet also distant im of the belief that people are what makes a place a home and ive struggled to find a community here i also loved all the neighborhood eateries on the west coast where i could get a fantastic complex or comforting meal for cheap and i just havent found those here well see what happens when i graduate but ive had so many people tell me that deep friendships are hard to form here and it just gets harder as i get older and dating is a nightmare i also dont want to uproot yet again having done  cross country moves in the last  years but also missing the thrills
visit the holiday train display at the us botanic garden by the capitol if that doesnt give you good vibes i dont know what to tell ya
because dc sucks ass
part of that is the cyclical nature of the city a bunch of people are here only during the week congress is out for months at a time
i have similar feelings that youre describing and i think that what other people have said about community is a big part a lot of dc is hyper transient so there arent a ton of neighborhoods where people spend large portions of their life think that makes it feel less loved i think admo and shaw neighborhoods might have more of what youre looking for
check out the events at as you are bar on cap hill  even working out of the coffee shop during the day
i moved here from hong kong a few months back and i dont like it here either
ive been here for  months and i sorta agree with you and commented elsewhere here on dc culturehttpswwwredditcomrwashingtondccommentszzidtryingtounderstandwhyimstrugglingtolovedcjayrqwhen i reflect on why i moved here its always a focus on career career career and im positive im not alone in that everyone seems like they bring baggage some good some bad from other places if that makes sense and theres an understandable emphasis on uglier realities of life like politics power and the military industrial complex ive met a lot of selfish people who see themselves as the main character in the story of their big dc career which part of me understandsbut there are almost limitless opportunities to find groups to connect with outside all the ugliness im a hypocrite because i critique all these things but dont put in the work to be outgoing and find something new im aiming to change that in  i hope you find whatever youre looking for too
to be completely honest after living here for almost a decade i am still of the conclusion that dc just isnt that great a place for most people im yet to meet someone irl who sincerely loves the city in the same way that people love new york or london or tokyo or paris or wherever though im sure people will try to convince you on this subthats okay though its still possible to have a great life somewhere that isnt that great and there are plenty of great things about the city which is a really livable place even if as a whole it doesnt have that magic some other places have
i live here too dc does not compare to london  its still a great city but no comparison
im wondering if it isnt the lack of a personal connection the dc community tends to be transient for a lot of professions and that makes it hard to develop a communitys sense of self if you lack a romantic connection which you appear to have had in london that could also be factoring in my last shot at an answer is similarly woo but you never have a love like your first and it might just be that nothing will replace london for you
sometimes dc feels like a company town which can feel oppressive i cant say i love dc or as you say that it gives me the feels however what makes me want to live in dc is my family and friends dc buildings parks and monuments are beautiful but nothing beats being near those i love
i agree that there is a general sense that a huge chunk of the population is less stable because many people come for short term work school political campaigns internships etc another chunk come to start their career but leave at a certain point for more affordable locations because they are effectively priced out of decentsized permanent housing like for starting a familyit got to a point with me where i wondered if making new friends would even be worth it because theyd move and i personally struggle to maintain long distance friendships local people with roots typically arent interested in making new friends they have their circle of people alreadynot a lot to say here other than i went through the same thing and the few friends i still have also settled in the area and bought housing here
op ive lived here  years now and its hands down one of the best cities in america i have had many a good times in dc it definitely has a culture and many cultures it is such a rich town of experiences and cultures but since the pandemic it has been one of the most depressing low states of the city ive ever seen it is really sad a bit slower and just somewhat empty parts of the city used to be jumping most nights and theyre just empty now i do think your reason for being here and the following disappointments with relationships make the situation worse but its not all you the city is in a postpandemic low itself and it is slowly coming back to life also people themselves are in a postpandemic low and coming back to life so give yourself some grace maybe give the city some grace if you can and know that change is constant that means everything is constantly changing so if the good times sometimes become bad ones then the bad ones will also become good theres likely no magic wand or magic place to be in the world right now except for inside ones self where if we can set down judgement self criticism and self abandonment and pick up a radical self love and give that to ourselves because to keep it real many of us are just struggling to feel loved accepted and embraced give it to yourself first little by little whatever you can love is an inward then outward experience whatever is happening on the inside tends to reflect in the outer reality so focus on loving yourself being gentle and gracious with yourself as you heal you deserve every good thing you deserve patience and grace you are worthy many blessings
stop thinking and start living
im from dc its stale and filled with transplants who sucked the soul dry
i have been living in dc for seven years and i still dont love it have lived in admo foxhall and now silver springprobably has everything to do with the fact that i moved from vienna austria to here still think that most european cities are so much more liveable affordable and safer than us cities also much better infrastructure restaurants culture public transport etc in similar sized cities the one advantage dc has are definitely its residents so many interesting people i have gotten to meet over the years
everyone has different preferences and there is nothing wrong with that you dont need an explanation or justification you are allowed to simply like or not like a place im a dc area native who has lived in  different states all across the country in adulthood i also travel a lot i currently live in the bay area and simply dont like it here that isnt to say its awful and that there arent things i enjoy or appreciate here but at the end of the day it just isnt my cup of tea i dont live in san francisco but honestly it is my least favorite city of anywhere i have ever lived or traveled  we all have preferences i am fortunate to have this experience of living in different places but also am fortunate that i have the opportunity to move back to the dc area this summer which i am looking forward to since i like it better i wish you all the best in figuring out what is best for you and knowing that its okay to have your own preferences
nothing to understand its not the city its the people 
every us city except nyc or chicago is going to feel like a fake baby city compared to real megacity like london lol
you should prob move to one of those cities that gave you the feels
dc kinda blows thats why
imho youre right dc is mostly a soulless city most of the soul has been priced out of the city altogether with the exception of institutions that are marginal and probably not long for this world i think of places like rhizome bridge st books etc the soul of the city any sense of vitality is so disconnected from the citys transplants money and major industries that its unlikely to be felt unless youve got deep roots here theres nothing to defend or to be precious about in this city so i dont blame you or depression its ok to take it out on your surroundings
as a transplant who moved here for a job  years ago i still struggle feeling home in dc the pandemic didnt help dc is also atypical which is unique but also can be weird for the reasons other people including yourself have stated here id just try to meet some people
as someone that grew up in dc i can understand people in dc are transitional and mostly here for work school and a  rare find someone that actually grew up here to say why i love the city would sound like a david attenborough documentary dc isnt london though sometimes there are places you can still get a good english breakfast and a pint of ale  the national arboretum is great for long walks as well as the national hot house  but its no kew gardens
ive lived close to dc my entire life and agree  ive been to philly and ny city and you instantly know where you are when youre there  dc just lacks a certain cohesion to me
london is one of the best cities in the world no other city comes close besides singapore american cities are a joke compared to london honestly dc can be vibrant or soulless what makes or breaks a city is the community that you belong to
have you tried psychedelics they do a pretty good job with connecting people to themselvestheir environment
i think its because dc is super transient  people will downvote me for this but it doesnt have much culture and the culture it does have is shitty politics   so i totally empathize with youthere isnt anything that makes it feel like home  in new york city youve got bagels and pizza  washington dc isnt a place for anyone its an international city  anything you can find in dc you can find in any other city  that being said if you like the capital and the mall its great  i love the mall and the capital architecture almost as much as i love my america the beautiful parks pass and american parks
the city is great dc is one of the best places to be on the east coast maybe you need to do some soul searching thought and its fully understandable the place might not be the right time
i agree ive been here two years and its been disappointing its definitely a weekend city not much goes on during the week coming from fed hill its definitely a lot quieter overall
us cities are fucking trash compared to europe its not even close the public transport is dick the road infrastructure is dick the people are dick the cost of living and standard of living are dick its hard to get a good salary in europe but if you make over k across the pond your life is better than someone making k in the us no plazas no parks no communal energy i will say i recently moved here and couldnt agree more i spent  years in spain italy and greece  i have also lived in brooklyn dc just has no energy so many beautiful streets completely empty and it seems like even when there are people everyone is on edge i see white peoples in politics or homeless people on the sidewalks rarely anything else i was told this was an international metropolis
could it have something to do with the violence i was mugged in broad daylight at my front door a couple of months back i will be very grateful to move out of here and ive been a dc resident for most of the past  years
nyc is much closer to london then dc is dc is a city for people who dont like cities
i completely understand your experience moved here from philly a year ago and am already planning to move back i knew i loved philly but was excited to find things about a new city to love but there is no soul or personality here i feel alive again when im back in philly
i recently moved to dc i have lived many places in my life internationally as well as different parts of the us dc has been my least favorite by far in fact i despise it here i personally feel dc and the surrounding area is complete void of culture there is absolutely nothing to do besides eatdrink the hiking is terrible compared to other areas of the world and you are hours from the coast worst part of it all its a high cost of living area i am here for work and thats it like every other soulless individual that lives here
therapy love therapy then you will know if it is you or our wonderful city
friend ive been stuck here for almost  years this soulless lifeless cultureless simulacrum of a city is the way it is because of who its built for specifically in this century and it sounds like thats not you if you dont need to be here i recommend finding somewhere else to live
its too much of a transient work city outside of the africanamerican dc population who have been here for generations and theyre being pushed out by gentrification it doesnt allow for a sustained vibrant culture
been living in arlington near dc about  min drive for about  years you couldnt pay me enough to actually live in dc
nope i absolutely love it here one of the great capitols of the world totally understand how it must be difficult to transition from london another one of the worlds greats embrace the history  not thousands of years worth like london but the span of our nations existence
could also be because most people live in the suburbs commute to work and go live their lives in the burbs
my favorite thing about living in dc is its close proximity to baltimore
dont feel bad i lived in dc for  years and never had the tingles loved it or felt like home sometimes it just doesnt click and thats ok trust your instinct if you arent head over heels about where you live
youre still depressed that why you cant seek joy in thing ms you once did thats the literal definition of depression takes time
check out mt pleasant area you might get that feeling there
ive also lived in a lot of places you mentioned including europe partly why i love living in old town alexandria it has all the feels and old charm of european city
maybe you just like larger cities
maybe join a social group music dance acting outdoors elks or a service organization like rotary
do you like parties and dancing i never really felt connected to dc until i got a sense of the underground nightlife here theres a creative bent that flows through everything in the city its not as big of an art scene imo as opposed to baltimore or london but its there heres a good place to starthttpsracoguideuswashingtondc
i feel this exact way

i agree with this i had lived in cleveland park capitol hill and glover park for  years finally moved central city in august shawlogan circle and it really has shifted my experience in the city i have feels for the first time areas like mount pleasant  bloomingdale are also absolutely lovely and give completely different but new city sensations too
agreed current resident of the brookland area and from midwest love the vibe of this neighborhood
same here  i grew up in milwaukee and dc didnt feel like home until we moved to ne
ill check it out i havent been up there yet just googled it and the pictures look great
after living in so many cities i feel like they are like rorschach tests that reflect aspects of ourselves back at us i think you eloquently summarized the complex relationship between cities and human beings state of mind is so important
perhaps im biased but the obama years were a vibe had a lot of fun in the city during that time post pandemic i barely recognize some places
i think the real reason is that so many people move here for work and work only there are few people actually from here even the people from here are often the children of civil servants or government contractors who moved here decades ago for the same reasons you dont get a lot of multigenerational families who have been here for decades outside of the african american community dc is dead during the holidays clearly home is elsewhere for the vast majority of transplants theres little sense of civic pride its a company town at its heart quality of life is high but besides government shop talk theres little keeping residents feeling connected with one another and the city in generali know im only here still because of my job
it is easy to get away and stay away from the tourist zones most of them are concentrated on the mallwharf which is easy to avoid many locals not one of them avoid the mall for example like the plague having grown up in a touristy city philly i guess i learned early how to avoid tourists when they get annoying besides dc like philly tourists are only interested in areas that locals can avoid if they want mallindependence hall area for example
i feel this personally for me im a huge sports fan and while the city has some great teams with good facilities that are easily accessible i have a hard time identifying with something thats so important to me ive adopted some of the teams and have soft spots for others but im just not as passionate about wanting to go out and experience that in one way or another whether its watching at a bar or going to games like i would in other cities its not a flaw in the city but just a barrier thats keeping me from connecting with the city as much as i want toive also lived in transient areas of the city and metro area and just dont feel a deep connection to these neighborhoods sure i could move somewhere that has a better sense of community but speaking for myself it might feel better than it does now but nothing would be able to replicate the connection i feel to the community im from originally thats all to say i think the city is vast with culture even a perceived lack of culture because there are so many transplants and government employees gives the city a bit of a unique identity comparatively i do think its just very different for each individual whats for some isnt always for others and that can affect how connected people feel thats all on top of a chunk of the culture catering to tourism
so much of the culture feels like its not for us culture is meant to be ubiquitous in a town not some menagerie of different boxes youre supposed to acknowledge like youre wandering a museumim not dissing diversity or promoting ethnocentrism or anything like that but throwing a thousand different cultures into one city doesnt necessarily create this beautiful rainbow it can create a gray mess that lacks identity
i completely agree
its some of that but also that there are so many transplants and foreign workers in the area not to mention the fact we have a lot of foreign and domestic tourists as you say that it all combined kinda dulls out the city culture that you can see it also doesnt help that during holidays and the heights of tourist season a lot of residents tend to either leave town or stay home to avoid those from out of town
i think this is really well put its like when you have issues and you think that moving away will solve those issues until you realize theyve moved with you
and both are excellent places and have quite reasonable cost of living personally love fitler square and queen village and i just wasted  min looking at philly real estate sooo cheap
and be careful about philly and baltimore they arent for everybody people rave about the vibe living there is a whole nother story
whats the name of the book you read sounds like a great idea
this san francisco became a ghost town downtown during the early part of the pandemic and has mostly stayed fairly empty since even though nationalinternational tourists might be going back with everyone switching to remote wfh and then the massive layoffs happening in tech this year it will struggle for quite a while
i think this is a huge contribution factor i travel about  for work except during  and many cities have taken a huge hit in some way i used to really enjoy going out to eat and see live music in dc this year was my first year really trying to go out again not sure if its because of me getting older my bf fighting in ukraine this year or still remnants of a covid hit but everything feels a little off now i get the same feeling when i visit other cities for workjust kinda off
 was a nightmare for me mentally the worst depression ive ever had it could be that i associate dc with that now since i was in the thick of it when i moved here ive been in therapy for half a year and am considered mostly cured of depression and anxiety symptoms now
glad im not the only one i really cant put my finger on what it is exactly maybe just the height of the buildings seems like a silly reason not to love a place but there is something missing
which annual festivals are your favorites if you dont mind me asking
why havent you done this yourself if youve been here a decade and dont enjoy it just curious
thats really interesting glad to hear your perspective on it maybe i do just prefer londons energy
i go to boise every so often its crazy how many of those like  story luxury apartments have been built there over the past  years
do you have any recommendations for books or websites to learn more thats very interesting about it being like a movie set intentionally unfortunately i have a fairly weak understanding of architecture aside from ooh looks pretty and i think that might be part of whats limiting my vocabulary and understanding of why things just feel off
weird racial dynamics thats a first 
i absolutely agree most dc people stay between the lines for work image or other personal and social expectations this city was not always this way  housing costs must be addressed  people who must pay month to live surely dont want to rock the boat
well on behalf of all of the people who love living here and arent flat not particularly unique or boringsterilefeel free to fuck on out of here and find somewhere better to live
yup if interesting and nonpolitical wonks are forced out of the city this is what you get    the city depends on these high earners but they also strip any flavor and identity out of the city i am not talking about race but income diversity should be a real consideration hanging out with the affluent people of dc can be a real drag if all they talk about is money schools and who they know there must be more to a persons identity
hmm this is a good phrase to live by until its not sometimes a place really is just not a good fit for a person are there almost always small aspects or parts of a city that a person might find agreeable to them yeah probably might being somewhere else entirely make them feel much better overall mentally and socially also definitely possible but of course take a good look inward first before making decisions about where to be
yeah thats a bit how i feel with dc vs london shes great on paper and checks all of my boxes in theory but i cant stop thinking about my ex who is probably my ex for a reason 
ive absolutely wondered that too maybe im just getting old and jaded and the new city butterflies are just gone for good now after thinking about this all day and posting this thread ive decided i need to take a long trip back to london and do some serious soul searching while im there
same here for me i think its the lack of storefronts and small businesses instead developers have used this mix used way of shopping with big box stores which imo takes away the charm that other bigger cities have id love to be able to spend an entire day window shopping im also just missing the diversity its very segregated here with bars and restaurants catering mainly toward wealthier people there just isnt a good mix of different classes and cultures that i like
thanks for the edit so many transplants to dc refuse to integrate and continue to segregate themselves from those that were born and raised here and its really sad that people are still doing that in all those years that people clamored for gentrification well be careful what you wish for or you might just get it crime is still an issue in dc although its still much less than the way it was when i was growing up folks wanted to just move in to this city and make the big bucks  well they did that and yet they still arent happy  psawww st
also  and ive met a lot of people in similar situations i was definitely able to find some friends here but yeah it is something i had to actively work towards and plan into my schedule definitely not as easy as it would be if i was  i think
i also dislike sf and like dc its refreshing to hear someone else share that viewpoint
people who live in dc who think its awesome often times have no uswide nor world perspective  many european and asian cities make us cities services and lifestyle look substandard  for many americans whove lived overseas america looks like a dump a drugaddicted murderous irrational obesityfilled narrowminded disaster compared to most of the world  it looks that way because its largely true
i think my friends here are getting just as close as my friends in london were to me and i worked pretty hard to make a friend group i usually have plans every weekend and am trying to build a tribe but yeah somehow the idea of being totally alone in london feels more appealing than being with friends here sometimes i could go back it would just mean admitting that i made a mistake coming back to the us and that i wasted the last year and a half of my life when i could have been with my friends there building a future a year and a half really isnt that long in the grand scheme of things i guess but i am also tired of uprooting and wondering if im just chronically dissatisfiededit also if id stayed i would only be a year away from getting my citizenship in the uk now if i go back ill have to start over which means another  years of waiting to become a citizen and worrying about losing my job and visa it was a huge mistake to have to admit to making in a lot of ways
creepy  which person are youedit im literally here now which im guessing you know haha been working off my laptop all afternoon here
i remember feeling grateful every time i stepped outside to be living in such a beautiful place i used to stop and pick up garbage even because i wanted the streets to be clean and i was so proud of it when i made the decision to move it was midpandemic and i had been trapped in my house for a year if covid hadnt happened i doubt id have left
agree  ive been in the area for nearly a decade and recently moved back to europe not london and even in a smaller eu city the difference is notable besides the obvious differences better transit far more walkable theres just more culture and above all a sense of community and cohesion here theres festivals and things to do yearround people arent so damn hostile and on edge the entire time etcin dc i couldnt even afford to stay in the city i finally ended up out in fairfax county which is even more depressing nothing but cookie cutter townhome developments and shitty chain restaurants just look at rnova if you want to see what daily life is like out there  every post is either trafficjam memes or about guns sums up this area pretty wellunfortunately im only overseas temporarily and will likely get dragged back to dc in another couple of years my job is one of those dcdependent careers difficult to replicate outside of the area so moving to another us city isnt likely in the near future not looking forward to it
i find it ironic that people are downvoting you probably people that dont even have a passport
the fashion is alsonoticeably less impressive not a day went by when i was in england that i didnt see someone who took my breath away with their look and polish and i know london is known for being the least attractive of the european cities fashion and looks wise people in dc dont seem to dress any differently than they do in the suburbs i feel embarrassed dressing up here as if im being uppity for it the parks are depressing malcom x park has beautiful bones and potential but the grass is always poorly looked after and half dead this city seems to take no pride in its parks at all san francisco philly and new york by contrast all had lovely green spaces
i dont think the violence is any worse here than it is in any other us city ive lived in my ex moved back to san francisco and was literally shot at recently just while walking around near golden gate park shes also regretting leaving europe
i miss philly soo much i feel that same energy when i visit
not sure arlington is better in terms of having character
good grief  baltimore 
this i prefer other areas of dc to the one where i now live for  reasons cheaper in a dc sense only than the areas that i love so i go hang out in those areas as much as possible and am getting over it love dc and i feel very fortunate to live here now although fear of getting priced out is real also climate change but thats another issue fwiw lived in london for several years and you could not pay me any amount of  to move back there but was able to tolerate it more after moving from central london to  south london  pregentrified claphambattersea sounds like you should move too anyway different strokes
longtime ne resident and this must be why i love milwaukee so much
your not imagining it i live in brookland now lived in sw and trinidad lived in baltimore also i am looking to going back to baltimore dc just isnt what it was before the pandemic sadly
this is a nice idea but cities also exist like they have personalities attract certain people etc unlike a rorschach test you can not like dc for dc
 was incredibly fun
definitely was a different vibe that was when it was still chocolate city
i agree the best advice is to move to one of those cities that agrees with you i dont understand it i love dc and feel a lot of energy here ive always lived in capitol hill or the surrounding neighborhoods but i do wonder how many people who have a less rosy view of dc think of it more as k st or navy yard or other areas that are a bit antiseptic and hypertransient full of people in astronomicallypriced luxury apartments
 there are few people actually from herelol imagine believing this
  there are few people actually from here  you dont get a lot of multigenerational families who have been here for decades outside of the african american community dc is  black the africanamerican community is nearly half the city across all races about  of people in dc were born here there are not few people actually from here there are hundreds of thousands just apparently not the people you consider worthy of counting
i totally agree with this as a general concept my family is multi generational greek immigrants which back in the day was huge in dc but like everyone else theyve now moved out into bethesda fairfax moco etc dc culture really cant be isolated to just the boundaries of dc because of that unless youre talking about the african american community like you said which has largely retained their familycommunity in one general area so the culture of dc as a whole city gets spread so thin that it can feel different than other places i still love it so much because of the history the way this is the actual place government is and the protests that we shove in their faces as a result and this is where my family is but i can totally understand moving here with no roots and feeling kinda empty and not liking it much
do you work in the company i see this sentiment constantly online but its definitely not been true to what i experience but i also dont work for the government or in politics or in a politics adjacent job the only real difference from cities ive lived before is less focus on church as the primary community builder
im from dc and i roll my eyes every time someone says this if you live in one of those giant new apartment buildings and only hang out at with other white people at places like penn social yeah it feels like no one is from here if you live in a neighborhood and talk to your neighbors and people outside of your bubble you will find lots of locals when i lived in mt pleasant shaw and columbia heights most of my neighbors were from dc in dupont most were rich outoftowners at my predominantly white office im one of only two people from dc
preach
im not suggesting that its perfect but what about new york until more recently that city had all the cultures and distinct ethnic neighborhoods with generally more personality
yep especially this issues move with you many times it is not the place its the person
philly has a tremendous crime problem native here be ready to deal with that when i go home i have to listen to opinions about the latest heinous thing from just about everyone
op has already lived in both so you arent saying anything
im not the guy who mentioned books but i too found reading about dc as a real life breathing city very helpful two i liked were dream city by jaffe and sherwood and s street rising by ruben castenada
this is me subscribing to the thread for this answer very cool
not the thread op but also recommend free agents a history of washington dc graffitihttpcooldiscodancomshopfreeagentsahistoryofwashingtondcgraffiti you definitely dont need to buy a  copy from the cool disco dan site but til theres a cool disco dan merch store rip the dc library system has copies
remindme  dayditto setting a reminder to check back
haha i guess although san francisco became a ghost town around 
it also cant be easy trying to compare a more vibrant scene in any city prepandemic to the more muted scene that followed
definitely worth bringing up with your therapistyou may be out of that depressive episode but it sounds like its effects are still lingering in some places i found a meme that says im fine but its a fragile sort of fine if something happens ill break and someone replied calling it eggshell fine that describes a lot of us right now when i shared that with my psychiatrist he upped the dosage on my secondary antidepressant and i feel a lot better
or maybe you just dont like dc i stay in the area for work but i dont like dc compared with other cities people will vehemently try to argue with you give it time but how you feel is how you feel
im not saying the oc is wrong but adding that not everyone likes every city regardless of mental health conditions at my most depressed i still managed to love the city i lived in im in a much happier place now but i dont personally like dc very much at one point i dreamed of living in dc some day and thought it was going to be everything i wanted but it didnt live up to my expectations i dont hold that against dc or regret moving here but i do look forward to changeeta what i forgot i have similar feelings to you i sometimes feel like dc isnt an authentic city i love my friends here and uprooting sounds miserable but i dread living here longterm even more ultimately when my lease came up for renewal and i was looking at only being able to afford the  to  month options i knew that my decision would be to leave
dc is more segregated by income level than many other cities certainly baltimore philly nyc and probably even london from what i remember the last time i was there  years ago for example youll never be in a bar in dc having a random conversation with a construction worker on one side of you and a bond broker on the other side which happened the last time i was in manhattan the economic classes dont mix much here
im not quite sure what the difference is but i felt so much more like myself during my visits to baltimore and philly compared to how i felt living in dc those places felt different to me and i felt more at home and emotionally like my normal self  i think im used to dirtiergrungier cities and that might be part of it
growing up in the dc area in the s i can recall when washingtonian would occasionally have cover articles comparing dc and baltimore  and it would always come down to something along the lines of sure were better educated and make more money but baltimore has character and is ethnic and working class
no youre not the only one ive felt this way always and preferred bmore for feeling like a real city and for having character like ethnic neighborhoods a working class and an arts community someone once said to me that dc is too prissy and i think that summed it up for me
i will say even in dc different neighbourhoods have very different feels im much happier when im east of the river in anacostia or in northeast dc like around brookland
you are not alone
i blame the people who didnt grow up in the dmv for why the cities vibe is off
down in the reeds is a very homegrown festival funk parade also art all night is a cool neighborhood based event
i was in an industry that was very hard to break into but had many opportunities here i had a foothold here that would have been hard to establish again somewhere else and thought id move after a couple years in my first full time position but it turns out i didnt want to stay in that field and then needed my networkstability to make a switch and poof  over a decade has gone by ive made friends over and over again as people move and have community here but i feel a sense of belonging elsewhere and want that again someday im working on that now  wish me luck and fwiw its not that dc is terrible i certainly have had good times here but i know that op means when they say they never clicked in spite of working hard to
thats a long story but you cant only point to the us everyone does it especially when you build a city knowing it is going to be a capitol a key thing i looked at for example is the appropriation of classical architecture as a signifier of empire across western and even some eastern countries the greeks and romans started it but so did the french the nazis etc its changed a lot over the centuries too and the meaning has evolved like a comet picking up space dust in terms of dcs history there are historic trails around with markers that are great to read theres a series around federal triangle another in southwest there may be others i dont know other accessible things could include documentary series the building museum the smithsonian castle or even the architect of the capitol gsas website where they list things such as how moses is in the pediment of the supreme court in terms of reading you can get into the weeds of architectural theory fast but message me if you want my whole references list lol kevin lynch image of the city kirk savage monument wars james scott seeing like a state come to mind
the last thing ill add here is that the national mall monuments and federal buildings are not nor should they be the only face of the city its identity is also made up of all of the ordinary buildings and people that have lived and worked in them that make up the rest of the  of the district so id encourage you to look at it that way too
for books dream city urban odyssey chocolate city gogo live also check out and get a library card the mlk branch of the dc public library they have fantastic exhibits of local history a special collection and a ton of historical recordings from residents
you should check out the carnegie library where the apple store is upstairs is a wonderful exhibition on dc history dc is on of the most organic cities in the us people have been uprooted from so many neighborhoods and that has created some big gaps believe or not but there was a large jewish neighborhood in se at one time and where union station is there was a polish hood the fact that dc doesnt have real selfgovernment has hampered the culture dramatically all laws in dc require the approval of the us congress and all prosecutions are done by the us attorney appointed by the president you get convicted and you go to a federal prison its just a strange place most folks arent invested in city so the political situation sucksbut i digress i think it would do you good to get our of georgetown that spot hasnt been a representation of dc since the s
ie a bunch of rich white people gentrifying neighborhoods with in this house lawn signs yet moving out of dc when their kids get to middle school because the schools arent white enough
my point exactly
wheres here you live in rockville
well you live in rockville not dc you can relax
i thought of some experiences that endeared me to dc sitting in the booth at florida avenue grill where mlk planned the march on washington getting a daytime guided tour of frederick douglass house and his neighborhood haunts in anacostia visiting abraham lincolns cottage and soldiers home in petworth eating a meal at saints paradise the cafeteria for a church in south shawunrelated to these experiences i recommend watching fxs the americans streaming on hulu its based in dc during the cold war and captures an aura of the city i find captivating
the lack of small businesses is a huge thing i was just in philly and it was like night and day compared to here
its interesting that you have a solid group of friends and a lot of social plans but still arent liking the city do you hangoutdo the same things when you go out have you explored different neighborhoods especially because i feel like there are enough pockets in dc that gives the same feel as baltimore h st brookland mt pleasant georgia ave etc im curious as to what the issue is and if it is maybe just something about the city that turns you offalso what did you do to find friends here at this age
great to hear this im about to move from sf to dc
on some level i agree with you though i find often the grass is greener people only look at a few dimensions of how its so much better living somewhere else which retards their ability to make the best of it herei give europeans the benefit of the doubt because often times their cities are better in many dimensions but then if you point out that they are making    times more working in dcfor americans that studied abroad one semester in rome its pretty tiresome to hear about how much cooler europe is as if one can just snap their fingers and immigrant somewhere that doesnt really want them where they dont speak the language and they dont have any legal right to make by american standards poverty wagesbut yea us cities have a lot wrong with them on that point we can agreeendrantedit and i dont often hear latin americans africans or asians complain to the extent of europeans nor do americans on the whole lift those places up as some idealized disneylands where life is great all the time perhaps for mostly obvious geopolitical and socioeconomic reasons with some notable exceptions japan and korea for instance though neither are issuefree places for westerners to build a life
omg no i was just thinking it is such a chill space and based on your name you would prob like it i went for bingo and was a winner the other night the owners are very chill also it feels like central perk almost and has improved the community imo on the hill exponentially
have you been to rock creek park kingman island teddy roosevelt island the aquatic park when the water lillies are in bloom i feel like dc has beautiful nature spaces for a big city
a lot of the parks including malcolm x are run by the national park service not the city and theyre just not a priority for nps unfortunately
honestly i think some people might say that they prefer dc that way but yes people dont really dress differently from the suburbs  similar to how some people prefer a pretty ui vs a functional system i think dc does prefer function over form not to say you cant have both but both requires a lot of effort   this city seems to take no pride in its parks at all san francisco philly and new york by contrast all had lovely green spacesas stated the national park service runs a lot of parks and has other priorities and well funding issues too  your comment reminded me of this tweet  httpstwittercommaustermuhlestatus
i just dont think that emphasis on superficiality and looks fits for dc much its a city built up by nerds trying to make things more efficient and seek function over form
bold move calling uk europe
possibly but ive never been the victim of violence in any other city and ive never experienced so much grief simply for being white
i never said arlington was great either i come from miami so totally different vibe
i feel like this fall it switched back to where things were prepandemic  what do you think it still missing
i fully agree with your last sentence spent some of my teenage years in nova and whenever id ask someone why they didnt like dc the most common answer was along the lines of idc about politics like bro whatmy dad grew up in the city so i was raised on stories of  and fugazi and bitch set me up and the bullets rip many people just think about the white house and monuments i just wish more transplants took the time to learn about the place they live in
everyones different but as a transplant who came here  years ago ive seen so many people come and go in my time here i socially dont really feel stable here a bunch of friends left recently and i find myself back on the streets trying to make new friends again it sucks i just chalk it up to the fact that most transplants come here for school or work and then move on and the fact that a lot of people move on makes it less likely for people to staythe amenities found in dc can be easily found in most other cities theres nothing particularly special because theres no local culture to keep people grounded and feel like they are part of a community here outside of work or whatever social circles they have managed to drum up on their own
yeah this shit is so tone deaf this thread is full of people to dense to realize they are making a whole city generalization  based on who they chose to surround themselves with
i take that back there are many people from here but most transplants never get to meet them or interact with them in a meaningful way the local african american communities and other ethnic communities like it mostly keep themselves in the background as your uber driver the metro station manager the cashier at your grocery store etc
 of people being born here seems awfully low to me youre making a lot of assumptions about that persons intent without any evidence that the figure you cite is typical or high compared to other places
got em
point taken my point is that most transplants will never get to meaningfully interact with many people from this community most local african americans do not come out to meetups or other events that generally cater to transplants
i do work for the government indirectly yes in a quasigovernmental agency its government but not officially government yet it is government in substance i did work for the federal government at one point
so many of these posts are just why is this city not entertaining me with no effort on my part or involvement in any community whatsoever as if any city does that this is pretty much the easiest city ive met to make friends in but people complain how cold and cliquey people are i wish it werent so but i have a feeling the posters are bad at socializing or have a shitty attitude that people dont want to be around
according to thishttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofunitedstatescitiesbycrimerate philly has a lower overall violent crime rate than dc

yeah the fact that you see the things on paper that should give you the tingles and everything feels flat absolutely sounds like depression is playing a role idk what your therapist is like but it can be easy to see depression and anxiety as better if your starting point was really bad but sometimes it can morph from severe to a more sustained blahbut i also think the reason you ended up here could also be affecting things irrespective of the depression angle not just the fact that you were in the thick of it but that you didnt end up here amid a romance or to begin an exciting new chapter or whatever exciting circumstances you might have had when moving to other cities that youve loved your move here came from a breakup and heartache and all that which can certainly taint things many years ago i did my undergrad in a city that everyone loovvvvves and i think id have loved it too if id lived there later and i appreciated things about it but all my best friends were experiencing college together in our home state and i had a couple rough breakups and i ended up feeling like i hated it there which in hindsight was definitely all because of those circumstances and nothing to do with the city i also lived overseas for a couple years and i know how we can get a bit spoiled by always having enchanting places around us  enchanting for their beauty and history but also sometimes specifically because theyre not ours and we havent spent our lives also dealing with the very mundane lessenchanting thingsand so while its definitely true that not every city will be loved by everyone based on the other cities that you do love its hard for me to imagine that you wouldnt find some of those things in dc under other circumstances i also think that this being on your mind and now being preoccupied by questions of why dont i love this city i should love this city can affect things too to always be headoverheels about every place we live would be an incredibly privileged position that most of us wont experience but its also an unrealistic expectation and can often be the result of essentially othering the city instead of really becoming a resident not saying you have that exact expectation but i think throughout my s i got caught in that sometimes and i get a bit of that feeling from your post in reality we may have better luck getting or getting back to that enchantment if we let go of that a little and just get to know a place not dissimilar from dating really  its hard to get to any kind of healthy relationship or even know how you feel if you come out of a breakup and start dating someone with a mentality of ok i should love this person why dont i love this person is something wrong with him is it me why dont i love him etc in some cases yeah maybe hes not for you in other cases those thoughts will interfere so much that itll be impossible to even recognize the ways they might be great for youanyway yes talk to your therapist about it and i wish you the best figuring stuff out
oof eggshell fine hits hard
i dont like dc is different than dc has nothing to offer the former is a reasonable opinion the latter is nonsense
related dc doesnt really have a white working class the way that philly and baltimore do  unlike those two cities the majority of dcs white population are year college graduates usually in professionalmanagerial class jobs
but i feel a sense of belonging elsewhere and want that again somedayim confident you can find what youre looking for even if it doesnt happen next week or next month or next year any advice youd give to a  year old that just moved here in november and is feeling myself pulled into the same mindset any general advice for someone in their late twentieswishing the best of luck to you in your journey and for  to be an excellent year
get out of georgetown yea probs lol didnt know about carnegie having an exhibit but there is also one in mlk library which also happens to be a cool building not that carnegie isnt but cmon apple
i think the phrase was weirder than the example they are some many actual racial things that goes on that this wouldnt register for black people that actually have seen real racial discrimination violence etc here i was thinking weird was gonna be at least going to mean abnormal racial issues
i dont think its the racial makeup of the schools thats the issue
sounding like we should get the fuck out of rockville and find somewhere better to live
not sure why i need to justify myself to you but i lived in the district for more than a decade moved to the burbs a year ago because i couldnt afford to buy in the district and am in the district almost every day for work
i found a lot of them through living with roommates i can afford to live alone but i thought itd be good for meeting people to live with others especially since i moved here in the pandemic since my roommates are late s early s i met their friends and expanded out that way ive also met friends at meetup groups and bars if im going out with a friend and i see someone who looks around my age sitting alone ill strike up a conversation made two great friends that way theyre often recent transplants or are out trying to make new friends too if theyre somewhere alonexbedit for hanging out we usually eat dinner somewhere on th or go out in adams morgan i agree there are plenty of vibrant spots in dc which is why im not sure why i just dont feel them
oh thats funny yeah i do go there to work sometimes including when i made this post  i like it a lot
fair enough
same my mom and uncles grew up in dc and the stories theyve shared have me absolutely entranced with the city from the bullets doug williams and chuck brown back in the day to movements like moechella now the spirit  culture of dc and the stories of its natives is strong
theres no local culture to keep people groundedim sorry but this is ridiculous you sound like youve just made zero effort to connect with local culture just because all the people you choose to interact with are transplants doesnt mean dc natives  and culture  dont exist
its blatantly false to say that dc has no local culture are you not a fan of live music because i will admit a lot of it revolves around that not the most accessible for everyone
please move out of the cityyou literally just said dc has no local culture
preach
  of people being born here seems awfully low to me youre making a lot of assumptionsi crunch census numbers all say but havent done this specifically id be surprised if dc were much different than other central metropolitan counties assuming  one way or another is a lot or a little is itself an assumption with  to back it up
never get to never want to most locals of any raceethnicity in any city are doing local things at local events they arent going to events that cater to transplants esp if they are known to cater to transplants
 most local african americans do not come out to meetups or other events that generally cater to transplantshow many gogos or eotr block parties have you made an effort to come out to
oh yeah what is crazy is how segregated dc is just look at the homicide data which isnt really fudged in the uswhite nonhispanic homicide rate  per year basically canada levelshispanic homicide rate black homicide rate  per yearif a white person in dc dies young it is because of a car crashif a black person in dc dies young it is because they were murdered
dunno about op but when people say philly has a terrible crime problemor is unsafe what they usually mean is that its more black people then they are used to and the city is more blue collar than other big cities
oh yes thats a good one too
thanks this is very detailed and thoughtful response yeah this is the first time ive moved somewhere in defeat rather than as the start of a new adventure its an okay place for my career but im a software developer and san francisco was definitely the it place to be for that baltimore was my first city out of college and an escape from living in the suburban south so i was enamored for a while the college friend that i had in dc who was supposed to be my touchstone and was my main reason for being here also frienddumped me a couple of months after i got here due to her own issues and insecurities about her own lack of progress in life which were exacerbated by my existence id had another close friend who id been hoping would move here too but who ended up picking a different cityxbpretty much i dont actually have a strong reason for being here aside from not wanting to pick up and move all over again a vague sense of discontent doesnt seem like a good enough reason especially when i worked so hard to make friends here and have spent hours exploring and researching neighborhoods and places here in an attempt to settle maybe this is just life i dont know
yuuuup
did i or op say that why are you replying with your random thought to my post and projecting
id say you just got here and havent given it a shot yet it can take a while to find your groove and thats ok but its also ok and not a value judgement of your character if you dont vibe with a place because its hard to make community or other places have things you want that arent accessible here what has made this city fun is the friends ive made and exploring the history and subcultures of this area with them ive made friends through work very carefully i try to keep my personal and professional life separate online through my religious community and niche interests people dont really smile or talk to strangers like they do back home so i dont find large events or festivals great ways to meet people if i just moved here and didnt know what to do id look up dc on atlas obscura and have fun visiting these places with a buddy or two
probably a poor or unclear choice of words on my part imagining that people can see into my brain through a few words
not looking for any justifications but i think your situation does demonstrate what some commenters are saying about dc lacking community or being transientexcessively workfocused what will be left here if even people who genuinely love dc cannot afford to put down roots and eventually have to move outside the city itself
hell yeah chuck rare essence northeast groovers chocolate city baby in the most positive of ways i still chuckle when i hear mayor marion barrys name bro got caught smokin crack with some prostitutes and still got reelectedair florida  dmv has been home for  years i love the height restriction for buildings in dc too henrys soul cafe i could go on i love dc
moechella is fairly new lolbut when people try to say chocolate city has no soul at first im irritated but then im happy because that means its still pure and organic and only the right people know about it
this there is a vibrant local culture gogo is the most wellknown but like any other large american city there is plenty of local culture esp beyond music
local culture is a nebulous thing its far more than the art museum or volunteer events put on by a charity its a bunch of shared myths stories legends and customs that binds all people of a region together dc has many wonderful local cultures but they do not speak for everyone here as a whole unlike other cities
deleted
i can see why this statment offends but dc is one of the most segregated cities in the country it can be difficult to access the local culture and mix and mingle so i understand why the statement is offensive i share a similar hatred of dc but i would say that it is a result segregation combined with the high rent that results in turnover my hatred of this city runs deep but i could see if someone had a stable community and a history here they would feel at home and have positive associations
u think its local culture in the city still i felt that leave when the gentrification happened
dc also has a huge roller skating culture and is a rollersksting hub with its own styledc is actually called snap city in the skate world
what makes dcs live music scene special is it a scene that everyone can relate to like the honky tonk culture in nashville where its all front and center for all to revel in and share
housing prices of sucked the soul out of dc dc culture used to be more than gogo and block parties the cost of living has really pushed creativity to maryland and other low cost pockets dc had a really awesome house music scene international music scene clubs with people from all over the world now gogo music gets pushed because politicians really depend on that population to vote them back in and singing and dancing is a familiar bag of tricks it is a bit of patronizing and not truly a representation of the rich creative and interesting identities that used to exist in dc bring in more affordable housing for creatives and you will see a more interesting city
lol people dont know dc used to be chocolate city  years agoalso makes sense when you go to rnova and everyone thinks manassas is basically baltimore and pg county is about as safe as mogadishu
  im a software developer and san francisco was definitely the it place to be for thati mean yeah sf and nyc are the two places for that but they also have the highest col so its up to you if thats worth it the main thing id say about nyc is that their subway is s tier while id say dcs is a tier  i never went back to nyc postpandemic but i would also imagine that every city has been muted compared to prepandemic  also its kind of true that a lot of people only go to dc for work and live elsewhere
no this exchange itself is perfectly indicative of the weird racial dynamics of which you speak
im with you and i agree with what you said
definitely a fair point
yea i know moechella is a new movement i was painting a picture of the continuity of the citys culture and the roots of it loli appreciate the purityauthenticity of it tooit definitely hasnt been imitated i think theres a balance between maintaining its originality while also exposing others to it that would benefit the area as a whole  beyond
ok hear me out  i come in but do you see how what you wrote can be exclusionary and basically reinforce what folks are trying to communicate here a lot of dc locals are in very tight knit community and arent welcoming of newcomers they are very much protective of what they hold dear and want to cherish it and not let others in that might dilutechangehurt it and i can  respect why and those deep feelings but at the same time you have to respect that some people will end up having a hard time finding community here if they dont have family or friends that are here for the long haul they are left with a rotating cast of characters in their life and giant institutions ex smithsonian that cater to the masses but dont cater to their community specifically you can kind of be washed up in the in between if i didnt have my family and my religious community i would feel adrift too because what isnt big and generic is generally not a space im welcome or feel comfortable in or it something cool happens it burns out quickly because its too costly to make stuff happen here diy and local doesnt often survive for very long
im guessing your a majority culture person in other cities  sorry if this is an incorrect assumption but your perspective shows some bias  no local cultures in other cities speak for everyone  dcs culture and history has a lot to do with african american culture and history  just because you dont feel bound to it doesnt mean it doesnt exist  same is true elsewhere where many aspects of the local culture are built for the majority but if you are a member of that majority it may feel like it speaks for everyone while it actually does not
i had no idea about this soooo cool
thats culture for roller skaters not everyone in dc is a roller skater or can relate to that culture
genuinely asking if youve never heard of gogo because yes it is pretty close to that lol the genere is one of the best and most beautiful things to come out of this city gogo and dc are more or less synonymousnot to mention the fact that the hardcore scene that started in the s here was one of the first in the country our own bad brains were the first hardcore punk band formed on the east coast the  club is a national name skim through dischord records roster and its like a greatest hits listthe hardcore scene nowadays isnt near where it was in its height for a few reasons but gogo is still sort of a beating heart for this place
that has nothing to do with what i said i am also not from dc this is based on people claiming dc is soulless or has no culture the fact someone cant find a fitting is more on that individual than the cityits not hard to find tge culture in dc it just matters do you like it
this too
yep if you would like to know more reach out ill share information with you
where did i say everyone can enjoy it have you even triedmy comment was for saying dc has no local culture which is egregious
gogo  hardcore  the  club  dischordand nation used to be a top spot for edm artists to play at before it was called edmeslthievery corp were a huge big name label and actjazz soul and funk have deep dc rootsthe black cat was an important indie venue cofounded by dave grohl a nova nativetheres a lot of solid music culture and history in dc
dc punkhard core  no longer exists those bands play bmore and richmond nowthey build a gogo museum but do everything they can to make a real gogo illegal and gentrified the areas that produced the music gogo is now the sound of pg county and alexandria not dc in dc the only accepted gogo is the smooth rb version the rich bammas like theres no beat your feet playing in downtown smh dc is a town where artists come to see play we dont produce artists ourselves we actually discourage it dc music scene is soulless and dead
its pure only the right people know about it thats exclusionary i agree that their comment sucks too
has no local culture that everyone can be part of is what im saying
i never knew that thievery corporation was from dc thats news to me
know about and accepted in to are  different thingsmy point about that comment is its not commercialized or exploited the people who are involved were introduced to or stumbled upon and fell in love thats why i said what i said
anybody can be part of any culture they choose to be part of
yea they owned u st music hall before it closed and because privilege lounge lol which is basically a microcosm of what happened to the music scene in this area
dc is a great place to live people just like to complain on the internet
people post more when theyre upset about something than when theyre happy about something imo
people that are out and about living their happy lives are too busy to spend much time on reddit take what you see with a big grain of salt everyones experience is different living here
dc is the best place ive ever lived  moved here about  years ago did one year in arlington in between and have been in montgomery county md right by a metro stop and still work in downtown dc for the last ish years  there is crime traffic and general craziness just like any other city but for me the pros definitely outweigh the cons
no this sub disproportionately complains about dogs crime and driving way more than anyone i have met inperson in dc
this sub is  people who dont live here  hating dogs  crime and  good content
assuming you are considering moving to dc the city and not the surrounding areamany posts criticizing or expressing dissatisfaction with dc contain at least a grain of truth try to strip away any tone to consider what is valued or being said and see if it still resonates if you planning a move and throwing a dart at the map and just show up in dc there is a  chance you will be disappointed your dc experience depends on your values interests finances intentions and demographicsdc has two faces professionally this is a government and politics city a lot of people move here with intention of furthering their career as part of a life plan they may have been born into small talk questions tend to be what do you do who do you work for where do you live and do you own or rent  the posts asking where to watch political debates or congressional hearings are real  personal real life interests can feel secondary if you are arriving from the midwest and you arent somehow interested in politics it can feel alienating  locally and residentially if you are looking to move into dc the city it has changed a lot and continues to change if you hope to buy and eventually own a home dc is far more expensive than say columbus if you research you may find taxes and cost of living are known to be comparatively higher too in some condo buildings hoa fees can cost as much as rent with little justification  it might be smarter to buy a home if you can find one and selfinsure the maintenancerepairs that k monthly hoa fees supposedly offset anecdotally as someone who as lived in dc for thirty years there has always been tension among the citys demographics and it has heightened in the last  yrs ive become keenly aware that the person i know myself to be is not how i present to others ive randomly experienced being threatened shoulder checked shouted at and harassed while minding my own business going tofrom the grocery and running errands  in the name of justice neighbors have shared they are experiencing this toothe dc city government currently skews left and increasingly seems more principled than practical claiming to champion real washingtonians is a nostalgic dog whistle of a different kind that ignores the citys current demographics and history in macro it also heightens tensionsthe city has been a destination for large peaceful protests but political analysts claim dc will increasingly draw a more kinetic crowd like portland and other places after living here  yrs and watching things organize online that forecast seems more probable than possible culturally the city is home to many colleges and museums which are great for broadening horizons the restaurant scene can be trendy and expensive like anywhere else local music venues like anthem and  club attract wellknown and up and coming acts rock creek park is nice for watching the seasons change dc is also centrally located among the east coasts megalopolis and international airports which creates opportunity to explore when you are ready for that tldr dc the city offers a lot of nice amenities culture is a toss up and favors youth seeking professional advancement dcs residential life can feel like a high maintenance dysfunctional friend the cost of living if you arent careful can negate the advantages and set back your longer term financial goals  compared to living elsewhere
i would only go so far as to describe city subreddits as less ridiculous than nextdoor lots of good info but you have to take it with a grain of salt especially when theres brigading on hot button political stuff from people who dont even live there if you dont know anyone who has lived here i would say put a call out for friends of friends etc actually talking to locals really helped me in the decision to move and getting oriented once i was new here if you can visit going to neighborhood coffee shops etc and checking out the general vibe is helpful personally the thing i miss the most is the weirdsubculture stuff that was much more prevalent in tucson where im from baltimore tends to be more my speed check out the visionary art museum of coursedont base your opinions of baltimore on that sub lol
dc is a wonderful city and you should ignore most of the negativity in this subreddit except the part about how a lot of the cheap apartments on craigslist are scams always see an apt in person before paying any application fees
no the banter and focus you observe on reddit is not a proper reflection for this area or really any area for that matter  to put it in perspective of my friends in dc less than  of them are on reddit and thus their viewpoints are not reflected here
i moved from the columbus area to dc a little over a year ago one of the best decisions i ever made its more than expensive but the resources the culture the food the people the walkability make it worth it the more residential sides almost remind me of the outskirts of cincinnati but if there was an effective bus system and restaurants that were actually interesting you have to find your people if you dont anywhere will suck but there are enough social clubs volunteering opportunities and work happy hours to make that happen for you best of luck escaping ohios gravity
every city sub is like this people love to go online to vent or complain do not get your first impressions about dc or any other city from its subreddit that said a lot of the negativity you see here comes from a real place there are problems in dc its not all yuppies and monuments and brunch
i like living in dc and have only witnessed a very small smattering of the bad things people complain about all the time heresometimes i feel like since dc attracts a lot of high strung high achieving types you see a lot of more people from that crowd posting about every single little thing that they see wrong with the city its a city no city is perfect dc is better than most other cities in terms of quality of life and livability the mass transit is decent of course can things be better and can we do better yes but thats utopia there will be compromises if you dont like it here you can always go to a place that suits you better id imagine most people on this subreddit are welleducated and are in skilled professions so to do that isnt much of a stretch for many here
moved here knowing where i was going i am not disappointed its a big city with the usual problems of big cities it has major plusses moderate climate with  seasons fantastic cultural opportunities international and diverse major sports world class entertainment venues lovely green spaces iconic buildings and sculptures serviced by  major airports i love it here as i approach a full decade i have no plans to leave
i like to think of it like a yelp review people tend not to leave a review for an average experience and usually not even for a great one but have a negative experience at a restaurant and youd better believe that place is getting put onblast for it which makes places look a little negative onaverage as a result people are prone to complaints more than praise ingeneralthis is no different the warts and flaws everyone goes off about but the good part sometimes get a little buriedit has a lot of flaws as a city housing is expensive metro is a disaster tourist hordes can make it difficult to get around sometimes etc its also got a lot of great things going for itput another way i moved here in the final days of  and have never left so it cant be too terrible 
its reddit theres a bias towards grumpy people who share their thoughts behind a screen and not in person take that for what you will
this subreddit is  accurate reflection of life in dc and the people this is also true of the internet at large 
as many people have mentioned we do maybe like to complain on the internetbut also were complaining because we know dc can do better and should do betterdont forget that if people have given up they rarely bother to complain
i love dc it is not perfect and i complain on the internet about the ways it is not perfect but i love it in its imperfection
i love many things about dc as much as i accept the negatives ive had to deal with most of which have stemmed from not making enough money to live well in dc better now than before but im still ignoring the reality that i cant buy property id want here unless i can significantly change salary or relationship status if you think youll enjoy it and make enough money to have a fulfilling life here in the process then absolutely come if you think youll love it but maybe cant stay longterm it may still be worth renting here for a couple years come try it for yourself theres so many cultural activities different groups of interesting people good food options and ways of living that make it a great place to live
no not even close this sub has definitely taken a downturn since the pandemic started but the city is still wonderful
sums it uphttpsimgurcomactaxab
i was born in dc in   moved to va beach in   years later returned to work having lived in europe many years i loved the diverse culture dc is a small space but annapolis and eastern shore are close mountains along blue ridge parkway are close  day to day you cope with living in a federal city president motorcades that block traffic the bike paths are poorly engineered my son was cut off in a bike path and fractured both elbows you will need to live in an apartment unless youve got a million to spend on a home busses and taxis and uberlyft are great but expensive but a car is kind of useless any other questions
a majority of the posts i see here have been negativeyeah as a recent transplant that is how it seems like every other post is someone getting carjacked by literal children or assaulted on the metro it doesnt paint dc in the best light
former ohioan here who also moved to dc after grad school  i love it here for many reason but mostly just the city itself i love going for long walks with my dog checking out different restaurants and going to museums its a big city yet drivable its busy but not overwhelmingly so theres always something interesting going on on the weekend i find its a nice balance and the weather is more mild than ohio
i live in no virginia and have traveled a decent amount into dc i would recommend if possible to see if you spend a few days or a week or  with some friends or even rent an airbnb in dc to get a feel for the city there can be lots of cool stuff if you really enjoy the urban vibe but be cautioned the cost of living when looking at rent food going out parking et cetera is pre d high
i went to osu and have a couple very good friends in columbus still the biggest downsides to here seem to be housing  k gets you a serviceable sfh in much of columbus and a bedroom condo here and community  its just something you have to actively work at here in a way you dont have to in ohio the crime feels higher than columbus but i think thats mostly because in dc youre likely out in public more whereas cbus most people understandably just drive everywherei have to say though i know many other ohioans who are here and i can think of maybe three people from the dmv who ended up in oh take that as you will
i love it here moved here in  and still havent seen everything this area is like having  states i know dc is not one lol at your fingertips at once and its awesome also close to pa jersey north carolinaand a four hour drive or bus to nyc i grew up in upstate ny and while ive been to nyc many times i still think its nice i can hop a ride and be there theres something for everyone here i will say its super competitive here work and education wise and expensive but you make what you want of your experience 
honestly if you would consider not moving somewhere because of reddit dc might not be the place for you this city chews people up its called hollywood for ugly people for a reason
dc before the pandemic was a bustling vibrant beautiful city now its nothing like it was before  and the voters this year killed the restaurant industry come july good servers and bartenders all will be going to work in northern virginia
there is a gap between local relative comparisons and global comparisonsalthough people are right that the internet likes to complain there are other things going on here as wellask the question is dc a great place to live you will get a resounding yes there is a fair amount of selection bias in that answer of course but it is real this answer is founded in a global comparison of places to live am i better off in the dc environment than baltimore chicago la etc meanwhile the bitching about dc you see is actually a comment of local comparison or trend in time are things getting worse or better locally i think you are seeing evidence that things are getting worse in the city the trends of cities nationally having problems is very much a pandemic related issue with many factors dc isnt perhaps doing that much worse than others so again comparatively people will still want dc but at the same time they are identifying a trend to the negative
dc is a large city i wouldnt think any consensus would be meaningful a lot of people are crochety adoring frustrated and contented with the city also in my experience no city is going to be a good match for all people i really like the city but that opinion doesnt generate a ton of discussion people that enjoy the city are largely out enjoying the city not on this sub
i moved here  months ago i really enjoy it i came for a year of school but will be staying afterward and for the foreseeable future im originally from columbus too and imo you wont regret moving herei feel like a lot of transplant residents with complaints hadnt lived in a dense urban setting before moving here and are surprised by the proximity to wealth disparity crime etc its not worse and in some cases arguably better than any other major metro area in the country ny la chicago the bay etc
i cant think of a single city sub that is overly positive honestly
reddit is not reality the people in this subreddit are highly unrepresentative of dc residents as a whole
i complain about dc regularly but its easily my favorite city to live in in the world  best balance of quality of life and culture  check my post history to confirm  move here if you are on the fence at all its worth it
thats funny i love living in dc and this subreddit was a big part of me making the decision to move hereits not for everyone and there are very specific things people like to complain about if youre a straight single woman trying to get into a serious relationship it sounds like it kinda sucks for that if you dont like politics or are super conservative you might not love it but if youre a nerd with an impractical degree and delusions of grandeur youll fit right in
in between the fun and helpful posts this sub sometimes feels like a weird hategroup of sorts but the objects of hate are motorists tourists and people from nearby suburbs some of the people on here seem lonely and in need of friends for example i have yet to see anyone away from this sub   get angry over which name is used to refer to dca or talk about popping mirrors or puncturing tires on cars while on a bike ride tldr no
living right outside dc is best it is slightly safer if you choose a place near metro it will be easy to move around you wont need a car
the majority of us reddit users are white men between the ages of  and so its safe to say this subreddit is a decent reflection of how white men between the ages of  and  feel about dcthe demographics of the city do not match up with the demographics of reddit
like yelp people come here to complain if they dont have something to complain about theyre out enjoying their livesdc has its issues im not interested in living anywhere else
as someone that grew up in dc and still live in the same area of the city its good  like any major city there is crime income inequality and diversity more than other major cities many folks that move to the city dont come with an open mind to try and experience new things or want to learn about the history or the people
ive lived all over the country this is my favorite city to live in by far and i would choose it over almost anywhere else in the country if you ignore the crime and terrible customer service which is just par the course for us cities its the closest youll come to living in a european capital imo
like every place on the planet there are positives and negatives i would not base my opinions on whether to move somewhere on peoples comments on reddit the grass is green where you water it
i love this town and so do my friendsand most of my neighbors most people who live in dc are not in this sub
speaking as someone who still spends time in both places dc is a better place than columbus oh full stop you see me in the columbus sub shitting on ohio all the time
heres an example a women with a baby in a baby carriage are walking thru a cross walk a wheel on the carriage breaksin nyc people just help carry the baby carriage acrossin dc people ask if you need help then help carry the carriage across if they have timein la people start up a nice conversation if you need help provide suggestions then continue on their way while you move the carriagecurrently live in la still have prop in glover park miss walking to everything people like community in dc but la x more diverse friendly strangers more stuff to do both take min to get to say dupont circle or santa monica
i mean im not the biggest fan but thats not dcs fault i just learned too late that im not a big fan of cities in general i will say the public transportation is one of the best ive ever experienced even if its still far from perfect thats more a usa problem than a dc problem ive found great people here and a lot of resources that you couldnt find in a lot of other places if you like cities i think youll like dc
i love dc and honestly i cant think of another city in the us id prefer to live in dc has its problems and many of them are discussed here but i believe the benefits of the city vastly outweigh its issues my and my wifes jobs went fully remote after covid so we could live anywhere in the us but we choose to stay in dc because we love it here
no
i feel most ppl on this subreddit are younger and probably not native to the city just an observation
id treat this sub similar to next door in terms of what you see posted people are gonna be much more likely to post about their complaints than things they are happy about dc is a wonderful city and has great culture if you get out of downtown i love dc and dont plan to move anytime soon
it should be one data point but getting out and seeing the city is the best way to get reality  im currently living in dc and miami and i can tell you that people on this sub are way less disgruntle expect during the winter
please dont use reddit as a measure it hardly captures the general sentimentacross any given topic
dc is delightful ive lived here off and on over  years one of the very lucky and few who can say they were actually born in the city sorry arlingtonians love ya but its a cityhowever unlike other cities know what youre getting into the culture general vibe and why dc is dc sure its a political town but it has a deep cultural heritage be respectful of the folk who have made dc such an amazing city and youll be fine
every city sub is miserable i just moved here at the start of the december and i love it incredible place diverse historical fun beautiful warm compared to boston etc its great
dc is an awesome city and you would be hard pressed not to love it the dc subbreddit is full of entitled complainers trolls and gatekeepers and doesnt represent dc at all  i have a feeling there is an effort to shit on dc by outsiders but thats just a feeling i get from reading posts here
i live in dc and participate in a few dc related message boards  given the political nature of washington dc sadly dcrelated message boards are often the target of people who dont even live here who want to attack and denigrate and demonize who want to make dc seem like a complete cesspool of crime outofcontrol karens imposing unhinged wokeness or whatever else  and then there are the suburbanites who project hate on dc because of the commute theyve chosen for themselves  they constantly start threads to complain about bike lanes and other things  weve lived in dc for almost  years and enjoy it here  its very walkable there is a lot of green space and tons of great activities and amenities  i have a dcarea bucket list that has hundreds and hundreds of places to go and things to do which gives us fuel for every open weekend  is dc perfect  no  sure theres crime  but none of us has ever been the victim of crime in the  years weve lived here and i rarely hear of any of our friends and neighbors becoming victims of crime either  yeah there are some homeless people  many of the dcps schools are notoriously bad but we got lucky and got into a good charter and our kid got into a great university with plenty of scholarship money  housing can be expensive  many restaurants are overpriced for what they provide  theres always going to be things like that to complain about but those arent by any stretch unique to dc youll find the same situation in nyc philadelphia chicago or other big cities as well
i have lived all over the countrysouth midwest pacific nw nyc etcand dc is the best  the lack of skyscrapers being at the center of american politics the smithsonians and the people are what make it special
i have lived in dc off and on for the past  or so years i hope to be out of dc this spring and ill never come back the crime is crazy here i was recently robbed at knifepoint in broad daylight at my front door there is plenty to complain about here gun violence is off the charts others terrorize drivers and walkers alike with dirt bikes and the police have been told not to pursue them and its written off to dc culture the culture of dc stinks
most people in the sub are transients that are here temporarily sub  years but that is a reflection of the city because most people here arent from here and most likely wont stay here
dc is great  lots to offer i feel totally safe here except while biking  reddit is a cesspool  but damn is it entertaining i gotta spend less time on reddit
nah dc is awesome place to live especially young adults moved here after grad school it was a bit of sticker shock to me from midwest but the public transportation the amount of stuff going on the great food and everything yeah definitely worth the price
been here  years and lived in many places before dc hands down has become a great place to live its got everything you want  great food scene walkable public transportation amazing museums good music venues across the city and access to lots of bikinghiking opportunities  wine country isnt far not napa or sonoma but wont kill you either and nyc is a train ride away
from my experience for born and raised like myself this is home and we love our city transplants its not what they expected which is okay but its not like dc is the perfect city still the capital of the usa which comes with many fun things for a city
dc resident now and have spent a lot of time in columbus grew up in ohio and my brother went to osu and lived there for a while after  in my opinion if you like columbus youll love dc vibes wise id say they definitely have similarities adams morgan is n high street navy yard is short north probably like the columbus subreddit crime gets amplified especially when it is in nicer areas i have two small children and feel like the benefits of living here far outweigh any concerns about crime or the negatives that are often prevalent in the subreddit
local sub reddit starter pack the traffic is getting bad did anyone else hear an explosion the thing i like isnt as good as it was before im thinking about movingvisitingrentingbuying the crimepoliticianstaxesneighbors are out of control where can i go to be a little slutty
went to college here moved away for a long time missed it every other day finally got back dc like any other city it is what you make it dc works for some people doesnt work for others figure out what you want from a city if dc provides it and take it from there oh and its a big  city so it has all the negatives of a big city big rats problematic public transit sometimes crappy weather expensive real estate mean people deadly incidents  it also has cherry blossoms along a river in the spring eagles herons parks many free museums with world class exhibits fun and funny people a great metro findable decent apts i mean people complain about paris and somewhere there is site where people are doing exactly thatyou ll have to come here spend some time off the beaten track and see if it works for you
i lived in dc for over a decade after similarly graduating from grad school though it was also in the district before moving to the burbs during the summer  dc is a great city that i highly recommend living in and of which i also miss living in while living in dc i complained as much as anyone about the metro and occasionally about the council and crime rate but that didnt diminish my love of living in dc except for having no representation in congress so id recommend it in a heartbeat if it werent for the impossibly high house prices i would have stayed that said living fifteen minutes frombaltimore has its perks though it makes my morning commute to dc a pain in the ass as much as i hated the metro at times reading on the metro is far superior to being stuck in trafficas for this sub its mostly a reflection of the mood but id wager a lot of the crime posts especially those that rip on statehood are posted by outsiders
no city subreddit is an accurate description of the city its just an accurate description of the redditors in the city
i have lived in dc since  bought my house in  i used to love dc and now i want to move to where people are kinder i have seen people become meaner and more selfish the crime has really increased in my neighborhood for years i would hear gunshots every few months now and i am not exaggerating there are nearby about every  weeks a few months ago at pm a child was shot a few hundred ft from my house one time i dropped to the floor bec the shots were so close and i didnt know where they were coming from i volunteer monthly and help out my neighbors and do other things to try to spread the love in dc  would i recommend someone moving to dc now no it doesnt feel like the city i used to know
this subreddit is awful i moved to dc  years ago for work i left that job over  years ago and stayed because of how much i enjoy it here dont get me wrong it has issues but its what you make of it get out and explore meet new people  and be sure to eat at some of the unique restaurants around get out of the city too dc is in such an advantageous spot you can go to the beach go camping rock climbing brewerywinery distillery hopping theres so much history in the city and out of it all this to say sure theres shitty parts just like any city but its not hard to find the lovely parts i hope you guys give it a shot and enjoy it as much as i do
no
it does i have lived here for a long time i work for the dc gov i love this city its the best in the world imo but that doesnt mean you cant have complaints
this subreddit does not represent the true sentiment of dcthere are many great people throughout the city love it here
been here since  besides maybe salt lake city ut or santa cruz ca i cant think of a place in the us id rather bethat said violence  especially gun violence  is soaring in dc and everywhere else in the us so if you want to avoid violence and crime then leave the us or go somewhere suburban or very rural
dear bitchy online echo chamber are you guys a reasonable sample of how people think and act around here
i think that the nature of dc leads the sub to be populated by a larger than normal percentage of  conservatives who want to dunk on the swamp and  government workerscontractors who would rather not live in the dmv but have to because this is the only place they can work in their current jobmost people i know who live here like it but thats also obviously a biased group
this is a very selfselective group and people who have gripes are way more likely to post heres a randomly sampled scientific poll we did last year of dc residents httpswwwwashingtonpostcomdcmdvadcpollbowserwhiteelection
dc is a transient city so most of the posts made in this sub are usually from transplants anyway
no this sub is a terrible representation of dc
i moved here recently my main issue with the city is that its petty crime ridden
ive lived here for  years and i like it here i never plan to leave
no
just a marylander who works and commutes to dc with the occasional weekend trip to a museum or restaurant
people are really pessimistic here but dont let it sway you it also made me nervous before moving here but i absolutely love dc and dont regret the move at all
dc native here i love my city and it is honestly very different from a lot of other us cities yea it has negatives but it also has a lot of positives they just arent reflected well in this subreddit
you have to come to dc with a good base plenty of money and a good job if you dont its going to be hard to thrive in the city
dc is a fantastic city but it has problems that seem intractable and are a common thing for washingtonians to rally around complaining about them not solving them
no this is reddit it represents reddits sentiment towards dc
i find dc to be better than most us cities it has problems but has great culture food transit and job marketmilder climate with four seasons too
not even remotely close
no  there is a very specific range of people who post here actively and they are generally a very vocal minority
i love this city and ive been homeless  the last few months which imo has led me to apreciate it even more dc is awesome it will always have a place in my heart moe bob young shawty im practically a native at this point sbut fr tho i love it here and wouldnt trade my time and experience here for anything
people go out of their way to complain more than they would to say complimentary things on top of that any place looses its charm becomes boring presents issues once you live there and face the realities of life its the classic grass is greener idiom dc is a great city th largest city but nd largest public transportation free museums nature everywhere global culture due to it being the capital of the country lots of benefits of being here but like many cities has challenges both unique to dc and shared with all cities
the dc i see people often complain about on this sub is not the one i know and have known for  years theres stuff im less than enthusiastic about but crime and all the other things that seem to surface all the time here are not it its a wonderful place to live and its a city with all the normal things that come with that i challenge any of them to prove to me that dc is worse than it was in  let alone 
dc is terrible you should definitely believe all you hear in reddit and not come 
white people who didnt grow up in or near a big city are the ones who complain the most here youll be fine if you move to dc
i love dc was there two years and now in northern virginia like others have said some people just like to complain on the internet
no absolutely not most of the people on this reddit are probably dc transients and i say this as someone who has lived here for  years and isnt native but is less transient than most of the people on this reddit
ive lived in several large cities and all of them are full of complaining ive been here  months now and love it so far
definitely not its actually shocking how many commonly held opinions on this sub are unheard of among the people i know here
dc is great it has same problems as all cities
this is true overall people are not happy in dc its a city full of stress and angst i am from nj everybody takls to each other greets people in stores people are not as fearfulhere there is alot of fear and stress and it across all class levels poor  rich studentspeople are stressed outthe city is like a weight on the soulxbi lived in austin tx and florida but never felt like this there i love austin because people are like smiling all the time nj too maybe not smiling but they care about each other  in dc people just dont get involved they are detached and introspective and really dont care about each otherxbtht being said i am still here because the quality of life and things to do and gree space i have had to put effort into my social life i have a good group of friends who i met at church and sports groups so indivudals tend to be good people but the culture is stressful and unhappy not good for creative types
no way this is reddit lol
id say up until the pandemic this was a more cheerful sub now nextdooresque comments reach the top of news posts where they used to be downvoted to hell
 dc is a great city i miss it everyday
i love it here all places have their pros and cons but for me the pros outweigh the cons
lord no the majority of people who post here are like a shutin aunt who watches fox news all day and thinks the world is collapsing its a great place to live
something i learned from my own grad school experience if something is free there will be an abundance of supply its easy to apply this to people complaining on the internet   dc has so many great things to offer and there are a lot of folks who put a lot of time into highlighting all the amazing things this city can offer
nah i love living in dc its a great city i suspect a lot of the most negative people here are either from the suburbs or like georgetown
basicallyno
moving to the dc the city or including the surrounding areas northern va the dc metropolitan area is quite big if you include some of the counties in maryland and virginia
its not always my favorite but if you have to live anywhere in the us dc is one of the better places to live
i fell in love with dc so hard i moved from another country to live here
well i moved here after college just for a few years to get experience to get on my resume and move back home rust belt city as soon as i can that was in  im still here but i have been to a lot of going away happy hours
its a great city move here
people just like to complaini grew up in columbus and livework in dc now its a city with all the problems of most major cities but its a great place to live do some research into what neighborhoods would best fit your lifestyle and would be close to workplaces and whatnot youll be fine
dc is my favorite city i went to undergrad here and was thrilled to come back after grad school no regrets
ive lived here about  years and really love it ive been having a period of rediscovery in the last few months and its been delightful you get all the metropolitan perks with a small city feel
moved here  years ago and i couldnt see myself living anywhere else dc is fantastic
i love it here
dc is awesome dangerous in pockets but thats every city this place is amazing
deleted
yuppies in dc will forever be stuck in the colbert report mode circa 
dc is swell if i have my way i will never leave the dmv again
hi op i just moved here from columbus so happy to answer any specific questions about the differences between the twofor me personally ive always wanted to live here and i love it so far im a bit of a history buff so im really enjoying that part of it 
dc is truly a great place to live as others have mentioned several times the social life access to mass transit job opportunities an established but growing haute restaurant scene museums etc and like any other major city dc also has its problems to include crime and an incredibly high cost of living although safety should be at the top of your list when scouting any new area i would instead focus on the financials
no a very large majority of people who post here are not native washingtonians that doesnt mean their opinions are not valid but they do not represent the true sentiment of locals im from nyc and i say the same about the nyc sub
this subreddit does not accurately depict living in dc ive lived here for  years and its the best place ive lived yet lots of things to do conveniently located very green good layout i echo all the previous comments that people like to complain here about all the negative things and rarely share the many positive ones
been trying to also figure that out as well
this sub represents the whiny transplants who just moved here and cant handle the realities of coexistence and the grumpy natives who also cant handle the realities of coexistence
moved here  months ago and love it  and the metro isnt nearly as bad as reddit would make you think  but the bus system is as great as many posts have highlighted
op hasnt heard of popville 
yes people only find the energy to write a paragraph on an internet forum if things are excessively good or excessively bad for every post here complaining imagine  posts that read had a normal day with no weird incidents took a shit watched reruns of friends fell asleep
this is the answer sure we have our problems just like any other city that said dc has everything you would want and then some i hope you and your girlfriend feel welcome
this this right here
theres a very old saying that goes something like good news stops at every tavern while bad news flies on a ravens wing
 to this myself included
dis me i love dc and am usually too busy enjoying it to spend much time on reddit right now im pregnant bored and everything is difficult the fun has been replaced with whinging on the internet
same here yes im in bethesda now but was in dc proper for  years prior
a thousand times this people full of hate for dc either dont live here or just dont have great lives and probably wouldnt thrive anywhere this city is incredible
do you find living just outside of dc preferable to living within dccloser to downtown
i dont think i know anyone in dc in real life who doesnt love dogs i guess this is where everyone else hangs out
dogs need not apply
dont forget all the people who hate bicyclists and the people who hate cars 
a less ridiculous nextdoor is a great description lol baltimore is definitely a city to consider as well kinda just depends on where the cards fall jobwise
im also a previous az person love that you gave tucson a shoutout
 any other questions so what is the proper way to eat a fig
in the two cities i lived in columbus and buffalo both have been very car centric unfortunately dont i have ever found a use for columbus very lackluster public transit but excited to possibly even ditch my car for a city like dc
i agree  with this
thats exactly it you can always spot people who have never lived in a big city because they complain about things that anyone who grew up in a big city justdealswith
yeah probably couldve rephrased my post a little better that seems to be the case in the other city subs i follow just felt i wasnt seeing any positivity in this sub where others there are blips of happiness obviously digging deeper into the sub i found some  more friendly posts
for example i have yet to see anyone away from this sub   get angry over which name is used to refer to dca or talk about popping mirrors or puncturing tires on cars while on a bike ridethis is actually funny  i dont think ive ever seen anyone on this sub get mad about the dca thing but i do have one irl friend who demands that it be called dca and my mom who used to live in the area decades ago insists that its called national
still not even that its very selfselecting
i get that when i was younger i felt i was destined to live in one of the megacities in america but after visiting them more recently they were too much of a concrete jungle something i think dc does a better job of managing
thank you showing respect is key
this makes me feel better about moving down from nyc next month although i love the city i was born and raised in the south and it seems like dc is going to be the best fit for me culturally smaller but has metropolitan flare and is the center of the political universe im looking forward to it
i appreciate the n high st comparisons
leave the us would be key
scrolling subreddits are just part of this decision making process i am not stupid other than actually spending time in a city or having familyfriends that livelived there its difficult to get a locals take on what is goodbad funboring safedangerous in a city although reddit isnt best place for getting a feel on something it provides easy access to hundreds of thousands of opinions which i think can be useful even if not the most representative
its a lifestyle choice some people love the city for the walkability and density and closeness to museums or nightlife or whatever else floats their boat some people just prefer the suburbs some people love the city when theyre young and single and then move to the suburbs when they want to buy a house with a yard and have kids in the public schools ymmvmy suggestion is to start in the city and see if you like it if you dont its easy to move when your lease is up if you start in the burbs youll never really know what youre missing
i enjoy living just outside the city over in arlington im a  minute shot to the mall on th st but have a bit less traffic in the area i live price isnt too different for renting now either so it depends on what youd rather have all my work is downtown for the most part as well so i like to have that slight separation just my opinion overall dc is a great fun city with plenty to do
been here  years done both lived in the district for  years and va for  living in the district is a much differentbettermore urban experience and way more enjoyable as a  something with no kids
deleted
definitely live in dc first if you can afford it
i have been here for just over  years living in alexandria arlington and dc and dc is by far the best imho living just outside the district means you have to deal with all the frustrations of living innear a city with far fewer of the conveniences
i moved to dc seven years ago for a job at federal triangle i lived in dc for the first five years for the past two years i have lived in harpers ferry wv its about an hour a drive with light traffic or  hours on the marc i only go into the office once a week so its not bad at alli loved being in the city when i was young i met friends got married explored and grew as a professional and i still love going to the city for brunch or events but as i get a bit older i like being outside of it i own a house with a yard i live in a beautiful picturesque town with tons of outdoor activities but i still can visit dc or baltimore in about an hourmy only point is you cant go wrong did you ever watch the last episode of the officecreed bratton  it all seems so very arbitrary i applied for a job at this company because they were hiring i took a desk at the back because it was empty but no matter how to get there or where you end up human beings have this miraculous gift of making that place their home
mentioned this in another thread but would try an airbnb in places youre interested in neighborhoods in dc vary widely although the burbs are a bit more consistent for larger swaths of area
for us it was a purely financial decision  we were buying our first place and were priced out of any dc neighborhood we would have wanted to live in  were in rockville which is a little farther but i think somewhere like bethesda or arlington where i lived for a while is great  easy access to work and the resources of the city but a little more chill of a place to come back to  to be fair at this point in my life im past the point where easilyaccessible nightlife is a major factor  years ago i would have much rather been right in the middle of everythingedit or silver spring  also a great and popular just over the border option
depends on where you work and commute preference i definitely would not live in the city but thats my preference i stuck to silver spring and bethesda
inside the beltway outside of dc proper is my sweet spot easy enough to get downtown without all the hassle of it look into bethesdasilver springarlington areas
it depends where crime is my biggest complaint and crime is definitely out in the suburbs as well as the city not as bad but still there  read the washington post and see the crime
also dont forget the people who hate dogs riding bicycles
i know some folks love charm city but dc is on another level  ive lived in the are for  years and i can say that as far as revitalizations of cities on the east coast during that time dc is the winner  its a fantastic city with so much to offer and the beauty is that virtually every part of the city is being used well and is vibrant
fwiw i really enjoy living here  it took a while to get used to it but there are so many upsides amazing public transit compared to most of the us not internationally really convenient and walkable pretty accessible a lot open  hours tons of free stuff to do and sooooo much going on in the larger metro area too  whatever kind live music youre into its easy to find a show you like etc of course the rent prices are a downside but im also paid better than i was elsewhere so its still a net gain and youll hear about crime but i  feel safer than in tucson  theres just more people around if weird shit happens just my  cents best of luck with the move wherever you land
i miss tucson i mean i dont miss  and all you have is a swamp cooler but theres nowhere on earth like valley of the moon
go ask dh lawrence
depending on where you end up a carfree life is very doable in dc
the buses that go down high and neil were always serviceable for me when i wanted to do things in the short north or victorian village but yeah dc is absolutely next level you can even go without in some of the inner ring suburbs let alone much of the city proper
dca and national are the only correct names according to my circle of friends
i probably spend too much time on here when i should be working but at least once a month someone refers to dca as reagan and some national defender has to scold them over it
one of the things i love about dc and why ive been here for almost  years is all the open and green space since we dont have skyscrapers and very tall buildings it feels much more open
though honestly parts of arlington are more citylike than dc
one thing to be cognizant of is for people in dc people outside of it dont exist socially this is definitely true for recent transplants but once you find a relatively permanent social circle it goes away ive got friends in ashburn springfield shirlington bethesda and howard county in addition to dc and we all see each other quite often
man fuck those peddling pooches
and the dogs who dont live here who hate crime im talking of course about scruff mcgruff
haha the swamp box i remember when i first told my philly friend whos never been to the desert about the swamp cooler and they were blown away 
this is correct
i can absolutely confirm  i grew up in nj  minutes from nyc  a while back i did a summer internship in brooklyn after living down here for a couple years and all i could think when i went into work every morning was wow i do not miss new york as much as i thought i would  i know thats heresy to a lot of people but dc just feels so much more comfortable than ny for lack of a better word
husband grew up in new mexico with said swamp coolers and i was like whaaaaaaa they are a lovely passive cooling approach in a dry climate but he did say that the snakes which often took up residence in them were unappealing
its likely not an eitheror situation as described in the blog city council can be prowalkability and build parking spots that will cost hr and eventually be moneymakersedit likely
dc may say its a walkable city but not everyone who is in dc lives there  most of the people who work in dc live in va or md  try parking on th street h street union station georgetown k street etc  its tough  th street during any time is near impossible to find a parking spot
good not everyone is going to ride their bike to union market even if they build more parking everyone who wants to can still ride their bike there no one is stopping you
i am confused by the disconnect if you want people to come into the city from other areas and walk around they are going to have to park somewhere
 city council can be prowalkability and build parking spots that will cost hr and eventually be moneymakersif parking spots are moneymakers then why arent the private developers chomping at the bit to build them they know exactly what theyre doing asking dc to pay  
and it literally was an eitheror situation two atlarge councilmembers david grosso and elissa silverman proposed an amendment use that  million to fund a new entrance to the noma metro station nearly halving the walking distance to union market and to support additional affordable housing in the area
read the commentsjbg and the eden developers are politically connected with bowser and councilmemembers donators i have no problem with cars but the congestion is already high and many ways to spend that money to help customers gettherelook at the price negotiation  tells you you cant negotiate against your selfinterests 
no it kind of is urban land is a finite resource a place designed for autocentricticy is necessarily not designed for people
good point charging crazy rates for parking incentivizes walking in a roundabout sort of way
and bring in shoppers it works out to k each that isnt much considering they will pay for parking and draw in business it sounds like a good investment to me 
lets improve public transportation then park somewhere else if you dont live here get the cars out of the city
dc has a housing affordability crisis not a parking affordability lolz crisis 
use metro there is no reason to encourage driving here  
the idea is to decrease traffic then you have to discourage driving less parking is one way to do that
not really can you really say that this part of dc isnt walkable because the city council ignored a request to build another metro entrance
if julian says so in the comments section it must be true right
again por qu no los dos you can use all the buzzwords you want but  parking spots wont tip the scales in either direction
i would come into the city more and patronize businesses more if it were easier to park countless times when thinking about where to go for dinner for example i end up picking something in the suburbs rather than coming into the city because of the hassle of parking taking  minutes on metro is not an option
lets be realistic  most people dont like riding their train while its on fire and given the clientele for this area is primarily weekend and night driven waiting  minutes for a train and another for a transfer on each side of the trip
i mean people coming in from richmond etc 
as someone who lives east of the noma stop yes the lack of a tunnel here inhibits walkability one of my first thoughts on one of my first walks to the station was man why dont they build a tunnel here im sure im not the only one who has that thought
are you kidding me its been in the news and heres simple examplego to  the dc campaign contribution tracking site  google random names like james iker jbg cio kai reynolds c dev ofifcer  over k for both httpsefilingocfdcgovcontributionexpendituresearch
the idea is ff it were easier to park there would be even more traffic metro needs to improve but in my experience it wont take that long to get downtown
maybe the city isnt for you then
 the train has been pretty reliable of late   lets spend money on improving metro and bus service so we get greater reliability and shorter headways   both of your complaints are fixable in the short term adding more parking is adding to a long term problem
the counter to that argument would be that they can simply park at one of the terminal stations where the land can be used to build substantial parking infrastructure and then use public transportation to access the downtown core 
how much distance would it actually save 
so the city only for those who take public transportationok
ultimately its underground parking paid by the taxes collected on the actual property there in part to offset that parking cant be built under the historical spine of the market and that you have a university right next door to have parking influx  the negative externalities here are minimal and making it an issue strains credibilityi have no idea what your talking about on the weekends wmata continually has  minute headways which will suddenly become half hour headways  while they may have improved weekday service getting it to the level of asking someone to drive to a station then take the train in isnt a reasonable request  if we can improve reliability and increase rail coverage then we are talking but were talking a billion dollar venture compared to a couple million  
i guess you have to decide if tourist dollars are important if they are you want to make it easy for them to spend them if not important to the economy its a moot point 
hard to say and it depends on the design selected and where youre walking from probably a little less than a quartermileor four to five minutes but its not just the walking its also where you have to walk the sidewalks underneath the bridge over florida ave are incredibly narrow which is really discomforting when youre trying to pass someone both with umbrellas in the rain with traffic speeding past on the thoroughfare next to you that path would become a shared pedestrianbike path in the most recent plans i saw for the florida avenue safety project which would be even more terrible the tunnel would have opened up that space for bikes to use more freely while pedestrians could instead largely use the tunnel for metro access
public transportation and other modes of transit like cycling should certainly be prioritized over more automobile traffic piling more unfilled cars into a dense urban space is not an efficient way of moving people around and all of these cars decrease the quality of life of people who actually live in the citydc is choking to death on traffic adding more parking is not going to solve the transportation problem  it will make it worse by encouraging more people to drive we need to be looking at other solutions
many other cities around the world have no problem raking in tourist dollars despite the urban core being relatively inaccessible via car 
ok but until this public transportationcycling paradise shows itself what you say is nothing but wishes cars are popular because its the most efficient way of getting around with a city with dcs infrastructure this is not ny also why are you assuming investment in both parking for overcrowded areas and improving metro are mutually exclusive 
 also why are you assuming investment in both parking for overcrowded areas and improving metro are mutually exclusivenot  but they often are yeah transportation funds are finite road space is also finite putting in a bike lane or a dedicated bus lane to make biking or public transportation better means giving up driving space or parking and cars take up a fuckton of space so prioritizing using road space for bikes and transit increases the maximum throughput of humans vs vehicles
 also why are you assuming investment in both parking for overcrowded areas and improving metro are mutually exclusivein this case those were literally two different avenues for this funding to be diverted to
 cars are popular because its the most efficient way of getting around with a city with dcs infrastructurelol the fuck it is  minutes by car  minutes by bike the city is flat as shit it is by far more efficient and faster to get around by bikemopedscootermaybe convenientcomfortable is what you are looking for
gonna guess that ward  and ward  have the highest share of households that are considered families as opposed to singles group houses group quarters etc  what are the transitfriendlywalkable areas where people with young kids livegotcha id probably look at this in the inverse and go backwards from there where arent there a lot of kids as you pointed out u streetdupontlogan circle h street probably isnt as kid oriented and maybe some areas around universitiesmuch of dc has kids everywhere northern columbia heights and mt pleasant has a huge number of kids and pretty good connectivity and it seems like the presence stretches all the way to maryland whether thats to glen echo or hyattsville though connectors drops
yeah th street heights north of petworth seems to be similarly family oriented
lots of families in cleveland park and van ness
takomashepherd parkmanor park has tons of families
id say anywhere thats primarily townhouses hill east capitol hill petworth brookland outside of where all the new condos and apartments are shaw off the main streets etc
glover park tons of families makes house decorating for holidays awesome in the neighborhood
mt pleasant is not far from where you currently are and has a great neighborhood and community feel
petworth is pretty family oriented lots of families with younger kids there
lots of families in the swath from eckington through bloomingdale and truxton over to shaw
cap hill has tons of families lincoln park area 
capitol hill its a wonderful neighborhood for families
depends on how rich they are
maybe it has to do with the quality of public schools in various areas
the places with the best schools nearby
most dc children are being raised in areas you are probably too afraid to enter
riggs park not much to do up here but it keeps the houses more affordable than in interesting neighborhoods
fyi i live two blocks south of h st ne there are tons of families here and im happily carfree
brookland is very family heavy  lots of new homes going up too that probably will have a lot of new families both near metro technically edgewood and north of south dakota technically michigan park
and then between nd and th grade every one of them moves to ward 
you need a lot of  to afford a house there though
im from out of state h st ne is long is there  a landmark nearby to look at houses in the area
also brookland has the full housing stock with families in all types  townhouses both new builds and old  but also many single family homes with yards which is a big part of the attraction for many families
where in dc is that not true
id triangulate between the whole foods or giant on h street ne union station union market and eastern market the latter three all have metro stations were within walking distance to everything on that list its great and there are zillions of strollers everywhere both our next door neighbors have small children also the capital hill cluster schools are the more desirable public schools fyi some people aim to buy homes in bounds for those schools
east of the river trinidad far nw like michigan park etc
those are still lots of money
