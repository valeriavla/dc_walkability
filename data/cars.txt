i probably wouldnt be living in the area if it wasnt for metro
i didnt even bring my car when i moved to the area i cant even imagine what it would be like without the metro
i dont own a car if not for the metro and metrobus id be driving almost daily even more likely i wouldnt be living in dc as decent public transportation was toward the top of my list when deciding to move to a new city
my bike is a bigger reason my car is mostly a lawn ornament but metrorailmetrobus do replace at least a few car trips per week
for me its not so much that im driving less but that im going to things that i just wouldnt do if driving and then paying for parking were the only option especially now that im wfh theres no way id go to evening events downtown without the bustrain id probably go to the nats once per year vs  wed also need to be a two car household instead of oneso its a mix of saving money and opening up the city for me plus spending more money in ways that stay in the community vs sending it out to multinational companies via higher oilgas consumption and buying more cars
i use metro literally every single day on the other hand my car sometimes goes weeks at a time without seeing any use
im a top  capital bikeshare user and carless that and metro make cars unnecessary for my life and i couldnt be happier about it
agreedmy late wife and i bought our last house specifically because it was walking distance to a green line metro station while still being a short drive to her workplacei used to only drive to home depot  lowes and maybe the grocery store and  of those trips were on the weekend
i bought a car a year and a half ago for a job i left eight months later  but i work fulltime from home i live two blocks from a safeway and shopping including two cvss multiple restaurants and worst of all an amazing bookstore and a wonderful library with weekly booksales unfortunately since the car market has seemingly collapsed im upside down on my car i drive maybe once or twice a week and i complain but i have a good rate on insurance have good gas mileage and i love driving a speed plus its easier to visit friends in baltimore and family on the eastern shore
bro every now and again i have to jump my car bcuz i hardly drive it and the battery for lack of a better phrase just conks out
deleted
we had two cars downsized to one it gets out maybe once a week but super useful for trips outside of dc which are something like a monthly type thing
for me its the capital bike share if its above  i bike i love it i wish i felt safer but the bikes themselves and their ecosystem are great all else is metro which mostly takes me to work i havent explored far out yet been here  months now
thanks to metro uber and freemove i have not owned a car since i moved from upper nw to gallery place  years ago so unnecessary to drive if you plan ahead
the bus is a bigger reason why i only use my car a few times a months  i wouldnt have a car if my parents didnt live in a nontransit accessible part of central pa
i used to drive to work every day but i got the unlimited metro pass and no longer drive at all takes longer but i can read text people and do stuff instead of focusing on not crashing
ever since the silver line extension i drive only a couple of times a month and love it
same i take the metro every day to work car is just for the weekend basically
i do a combo of metro walking uber and driving depending on where i have to go right now i drive maybe  days each month it comes out to about k miles a year without metro it would probably be  days each week
sold my car and bought a very old fun car since reliability wouldnt be a concern i probably drive once or twice every couple of weeks access to things including other cities without a car is one of the main reasons we live here
im a dc native and although i grew up with my parents both owning cars and then moving away and living in densly populated cities i stand by my point to live carfree for the rest of my life i hate driving and i dont see the point in having one when i can just metrobikescooter everywhere with an ocassional uber ride no regrets i bike to work everyday i use metro mainly bus to run errandsvisit places and people scooter if i am in a rushrunning errands if i dont feel like biking and will uber ocassionaly not super often i dont regret it i would not be able to afford a car if i had one anyway
living in a walkable neighborhood is the reason my car stays in a garagemetro is the reason i own one in the first place
i drive twice a week once to my kids swim lesson and once to lidl or costco
i drive maybe once or twice a month if it werent for the metro i would probably drive a couple times a day the metro is a big part of the reason i moved here
i might be able to get by a bit but id still need a car to get to work out in tysons one day a weekim planning to move to baltimore soon though and probably will still do marc  metro for that one day i have to go into the office a week
i personally keep my car out of the city with family but since ive lived here i have only ever needed it about  or  times just to movepickup furniture or travel somewhere that requires a little bit more distance than the metro can take me the public transportation here is honestly working out super well for me
i wouldnt live in this area  the traffic would be appalling
when i stay in dc i park my car in a garage and dont use it til im leaving
were in brookland so we grocery shop in hyattsville typically i drive my car for about  minutes total every sunday to do so not as impressive as you op but i love that im only in it for ish hours a month now everything else is metro special shoutout h bus all the way
ill take the flip side of this  metro is not a convenient option from my location in the burbs i use it a single digit number of times per year mostly when i have friends in town and im playing tourist in the city with them all day i hate driving in this area more than words can describe but i do it every day out of necessity if metro were an option for my daily commute i would use it
how much more would you be driving if you needed to drive somewhere but didnt have an alternative mode of transportationi guess i would drive more frequentlythant makes sense  more  gotcha
zero i gave up on metro about  years ago after riding it for  years havent looked back dont miss it one bit at least not its current state it was fantastic in the s
i drive  days a week because of metro prepandemic i had a bus  metro commute and since the time schedules havent been back to normal i begrudgingly made the switch to the car commute then realized it was a blessing in disguise it reallyyyyy sucks if you miss the bus and next one is in  minutes then its just a domino effect to catching a train it takes me  min to drive or min public transportation hitting transfers door to door my company gives us either month for public transportation or free parking spot in the garage so it was a no brainer to be like jk can i switch plz its not even a cost thing bc i used to get month unlimited pass and pocket the rest of my transport benefitas service slowly rebounds i am starting to do a hybrid but damn is it rough to convert back after having the conveniences i comically got motion sickness when i took metro for first time in monthsin my non work commute my day to day i usually walk or ebike bc things i need are within walkingbiking distance im actually planning to move and broadening my geographical search to neighborhoods that arent directly on top metro line but within a mile and served by bus
i wouldnt live in a city without a metro or equivalent
not that much more the city is walkable and i work from home i can walk or ebike pretty much anywhere i need to bei mostly drive to visit friends in va or pick up specialty groceries in md
i was driving  some odd miles every day now i drivewalkbike a mile to the metro i cannot remember the last time i got gas its greatbiggest complaint is walking is uphill both ways so the band where the weather is good is very slim bike is quick but the drivers between home and the metro are nuts
someday i will convince my family to move downtown and the first thing i will do is turn my car into scraps
dailyi only really drive for pleasure here
bro this is def wmata burner account 
id go from driving  days a week for work to  i only drive those  days because i have to go from dc out to maryland and its not convenient at all to metrobus to that area id prefer to not drive at all and just metrowalk
ive lived here for a decade and happily never felt the need to own a car hell you can take the train to harpers ferry
 times a week and i would be so fucking miserable too
honestly not that much more i ride a motorcycle and my job requires me to make frequent random visits to client sites msp a car would be annoying but doable and metro doesnt go where i need itin addition since i spend the majority of my time in the city i live in the district proper i try to get out on the weekend easy to ride or drive my fiances car out  minutes to chesapeake beach or annapolis then it is to take public transportation same for the monthly costco trip i mostly take metro to go to the airport or to get back home after walking to the mallmuseums on a saturday  but its too slow at least compared to my motorcycle and doesnt go where i need it when i need it
same i thought about selling my car for a long time and debating just staying in dc but ill have to move back to car city la in a few years plus i got a car during covid with a  interest rate the extra costs of parking and insurance are tough and with inflation its hard to make the payments but i got  more years and then its all mine and by then ill probably be back in california
assuming we mean metrorail maybe month buses however
i got rid of my car bc of the metro its just a black hole of money otherwise plus i sleep better knowing i dont gotta move for street sweeping
between metro and my bike i havent driven in  weeks   work day starts the moment i walk in the door ends the moment i leave been since august and i have never been happier nor healthier with all the reading and riding ive been doing in the time i used to spend fighting traffic  doortodoor it is actually faster because i dont have to park and walk to my office
i need a car for work potential for having to go into work after metro hours  with silver line expansion i can start taking the metro and i think i might monday  because traffic has gotten even worse  i maybe drive on the weeknightweekend maybe once or twice a quarter
i live in ashburn and use the silver to get to workcan walk from my house to grocery and restaurants so my car happily sits at home most of the time  love the metro
opposite  live a  minute walk to a metro stop but hardly use it because it doesnt go to the places i need and it takes x longer than driving
i live out in the burbs the metro saves me a ton of driving in every day i dont have one of those fancy wfh jobs
i still drive from where i live it would take me an hour with multiple transfers to get to work for my mandatory in office day by car  minutes with a straight shot to the office by bike is  minutes
nice try wmata
i drive once a week to the office
i like the metro but only  a week  if i need to get somewhere quick or nowhere near a metro like shenandoah or great falls then i drive
wmata is the reason i drive every day
metro is too much of a hassle i live in dc and prefer to drive havent used the metro in about  years
live in the city but i never use metro uber walking and my whip is how i get around metro just isnt worth the hassle
i dont know id have to learn the bus schedule and then see if that was convenient for me to go to work
i drive more because i dont want to to get shot on the metro
metro is ass
i only drive for groceries and maybe going out of the city once a month
i havent lived yet in a city with a metro how are you grocery shopping do you just have it delivered
aside from driving to visit my partners family in nova twice a month i never drive id take the metro but the trip is unjustifiable for the time i spend out there been like this for about  years now
no difference i dont take the metro
i used to drive every day in my home townnow i drive once a week if that mostly just to not get the street sweeper tickets so  times a week
my battery keeps on dying because i only start her up maybe once a week or more
i never drive but tbh i dont even use metro either  i walk or bike everywhere i need to go but thats only because the nearest metro stations to me are all farther away than most of the places i need or want to go  if metro had more extensive coverage of the city and ran more frequently i would use it regularly  fuck cars though
i moved to dc so i would  never  have to drive again
i would love to get to the point where i dont use my car for days at a time i am in the pg suburbs so there is enough density to bike places but the bike infrastructure is just not there for a lot of trips most of the roads along the route  corridor are more like freeways and a lot of people do try to bikewalk but im not that brave
imagine if we had a relatively half way decent metro system
is this an ad for the metro
im going to be moving to dc next month  ive lived in the area for  years but have always commuted in  im planning on givinglending my car to my sister and using the metro uberlyfts and zip cars when i absolutely need a car  looking forward to not having a car really
i should probably use the metro more i tend to rely on uber while my car stays parked
metro is a big reason i  work from home and my car stays in the garage i was once caught on a train between archives and chinatown that caught fire havent really been a fan since
no car here all because of metro
after moving to dc with my partner we quickly realized that we rarely drove paying for parking for two car felt extremely excessive especially since we live by all the metro lines and almost never drove anywhere i ended up selling my car 
the metro is literally the reason i drive all the time  its awful
i think its been  years since i rode the metro i love my car
i absolutely love saying i havent seen my car in two months but the truth is i might have gone down to crank it up or just check to see if its still there because damn dc cars just up and disappear sometimes
coming from the los angeles area where i could not get anywhere without a car to living in dc without a car has been one of the best experiences of my lifemy main source of income is working as a freelance musician which means in an average week i visit  to  distinct locations in the dmv area to play which might be totally different than the gigs i had the previous week hauling around my gear on a bike trailercart  of the time my best option is to use capital bikeshare and i might use the metro or bus to get to the general vicinity sometimes ill ride my ebike instead especially if there are no cabi stations near my destination every once in a while i have to rent a car to play a gig way out in stevensville or somethingmy other source of income is delivering for uber eats which i do entirely on my ebike im pretty sure its actually faster sometimes than it would be by car especially in the thick of the cityif not for cabi metro and bus i would be doing so much driving and sitting in so much trafficlike i used to back home
same here nobody appreciates the metro like they should
i dont drive so the metro despite its many issues is really a lifesavior in the dc area its the main reason i go there and visit
i never had a car in dc or now in arlington dont need one take metro or bus or uber dont miss it because for me its less worry and i feel free walking keeps me healthy
not more but then again i bike on the custis trail into work daily
i love taking metro but the daily parking fees are expensive looking to ride a bike and lock it up for now im driving my beaterupper car on its last leg
one more thing transit enthusiasts join this local meetup  we do x monthly meetings  is a stationary meeting at the cleveland park library to learn the history triviaartstories and a moving meetup taking one of the lines or transit options check out transit enthusiasts of dc on meetup httpsmeetupscksxzlra
dense cities become quickly unlivable if every worker takes a car in every day the metro and the bus systems are the lifeblood of every big dynamic city
this is honestly true i moved here very much in an attempt to reduce my car usage and live somewhere where i could get my basic needs met without a car  work gym grocery shopping all things i can do without driving
yeah i wanted to grab coffee at union market today from the upper nw took my car since it was a little windy big mistake ended up driving to the area hit traffic and just went home hitting more traffic ended up being more than an hour back and forth next time ill metro lol
yep this
main reason i moved back to city metro has its faults but live in area without transit and spend hours in traffic for a year and tell me how bad metro is
same i sold my car right before moving here i didnt really have a choice because i needed the money but it would have been a good decision regardless i save so much money not owning a vehicle and having my employer pay for my metro commute
same we got rid of our cars knowing theyd be broken into parking would be a hassle and wed save tons of groceries delivered  uber  scooter for me  wife does  remote work based out of nyc
same between metrouberturo im still saving more money than i would if i was paying for gasparkinginsuranceand all the fun unexpected expenses with a car
same didnt buy a car when i got a job here and used the money i saved on paymentsinsurance to move to a more convenient location and take metro to work everyday instead
yeah we sold our cars back in kansas city a dozen years ago and never looked back
i moved to dc in  straight after college and left to go back home in    which is also when i bought my first car we did start using car share a bit after we had kids but theres no way we couldwould have continued to live in the area without metro
capitol bikeshare and the expansion of pbls across the city means i only drive once a week
yep the specter of parking and traffic will get me to bike pretty much anywhere in nearly any condition my car is used exclusively for shopping trips where im buying more than i can carry  trips far outside of the city
same 
where do you see that youre in the top  of bikeshare users
how many stations have you collected
why capital bike share vs getting your own bike at that point
adams morgan
yeah me too i need to go for a drive this weekend lol
i had this problem during the summer 
same
wait do you mean bmore to tysons commute
i took the bus recently for the first time since the pandemic and i was so motion sick 
metro astroturfing this sub is funny dont forget that they ran those defective trains knowingly for four years could have fixed them during the pandemics peak chose not to a train derailed and high level execs were allowed to resign without anyone facing consequences
backgood
""
i have the option of reserved parking space at my office but i opted for riding the metro instead it takes about the same amount of time but i can sit back and read a book whilst the train whisks me to the office instead of dealing with traffic
my i ask which neighborhood
the chances of being carjacked is multiple times higher every time youre getting in or out of your car at a parking lot pumping gas at a stop light or stop sign driving at night
there are walkable grocery stores near me and i have a granny cart if i need a lot of stuff
there are  main groceries harris teeter  trader joes giant and safeway in downtown bethesda and i live a few blocks from some of them i get produce from the weekly farmers market as well were a household of  and with all the restaurant options in the neighborhood we eat out a lot so not much to carry between groceries and home
when i lived in nyc specifically brooklyn i use a spinner suitcase with wheels but a lot of people use grocery carts perfectly normal  something like this  httpswwwamazoncomdbestproductstrolleyshoppingfoldabledpbkxmbg
i love the metro the more people that take the metro the less traffic i have to deal with on the street 
yeah i detest driving so i only move to walkable cities
do you have groceries delivered do you just not buy much at once or do you have a cart or wagon or something you take grocery shopping
i sometimes wish wed just pull the trigger and liquidate the car we only use occasionally it is like a child and their safety blanket the car is such a hassle to deal with

in the app go to the sidebar then view profile in the account settings section it should say the number of stations visited and which  of riders youre in im not sure how they calculate it but it seems like its by total stations visited rather than total distance or amount of rides so it could be more accurate
 
as both a person with a commuter bike and bikeshare different uses my commuter is good for when i have a safe place to store it my office but if im going out on the weekend or evenings i will almost always use a bikeshare no worries about theft plus if it gets late and i need to call a taxi home i dont have to come back for the bike drivers also give bikeshare users more roomthe thing about bikes is that they are so cheap compared to cars you usually can easily afford a bike and bike rental
im absolutely paranoid about my bikewheels getting stolen the convenience of being able to dock and forget about bikes is worth the extra few minutes of walking tofrom stations and the annual fee i also bike recreationally and use my fairly nice bike for that
i love cap bikeshare because i dont have to spend time findign spot for bike and i just dock it and go  i dont have to worry about bike being stolen
connecticut avenue a few blocks south of chevy chase circle
unfortunately we dont have a library here 
also describes dupont
yup  hours for the cheaper col and some other things going on in my life its manageable it could be more like h min if i left real early and drovebut i rather ride transit and least do something and have it take an extra hour
paying more taxes for metro  cheaper gas
me too
people who live within walking distance of a grocery store usually go multiple times a week and only carry a few bags back
buy groceries several times a week and have two carts  one for regular grocery trips and one for big grocery trips or bulky items
what are you keeping it for
yep they make it really pleasant if your route has then i go up and down th st nw and with the bike lights its awesome going from admo to downtown
ive got 
i have a bicycle and still use the bikeshare like  of the time ive had a bike stolen and i sometimes want to go one way with metro or uberlyft covering the return route
same for me
ahhh i didnt see that just the bookstore and i thought it was lost city books
weekend trips lol cars make us like toddlers we hold onto things for non rational reasons
cars are a luxury skip the need to rent when you can leave the city novamaryland etc with no planning for instance you can have friendsdate outside of city limits as well as be mobile beyond the convenience of which metro line is closest i know uber exists but most people that can afford the high cost of car ownership opt to have it even if it is not for everyday use
im tryna be like you
you could rent a car for pretty cheap get an airbnb with the money youd be saving on car insurance i sound like a commercial 
it can be a process like giving away old clothes or sentimental things that just take up space others might pressure you to keep it while you burn money on insurance gas and tickets when you can be spending that on better things
honestly its gonna be a total crapshoot to try and accurately predict how bad itll be and when make sure to take potential weather into account when planning your timing if its crucial that you arrive on time i would plan on the trip taking double the normal amount of time early is on time on time is late
its been a while since ive done it but in the past tuesday and wednesday before thanksgiving was awful traffic out of the city
amtrak
i feel like they always say tuesday afternoon is the worst time to depart for thanksgiving or at least that was the case last year something about more people taking wednesday off id recommend amtrak
might be worth it to drive out to eastern shore and up 
be driving down the road by am youd be past baltimore by  probably even around holiday times from my experience there isnt much traffic before  or so but once you start getting later than that it increases at an almost comedic rate if you wait til late morning it will be an absolute shitshow
we used to go to philly all the time to see friends for the weekend  if i couldnt be on the road by noon id just take the train up  traffic gets painful on i  plus unless you are staying in philly for the holiday you may get caught in crazy traffic leaving philly and coming home tooeta that would be getting on the road by noon on friday in case i wasnt clear
take  to  go up the bay bridge and up  in delaware youll get out by the christiana mall but give yourself a full five hours to get there
usually it takes  hours but the other day it took  hours due to accidents
i did today at  pm up  to nj and it was surprisingly fine somewhat heavier than usual for the first part until baltimore but like average  mph rather than  or higher that people normally goi know thats still a day before you but with wfh i do think it gets more spread out so you could be okayish
so there are no patterns right
tuesday too oof
its not that important i can go on a different day not worth the  bucks but it does seem like a few people think it will be unworkable
very helpful had no idea thanks
you mean for thanksgiving weekend
id rather just postpone at that point haha
leave early
not that i know of i would think there will be more traffic than usual just due to the holiday but im not sure that it would be consistent enough to be called a pattern holiday travel is such a headache good luck
fair i guess it depends on your tolerance for traffic id probably just bake in an extra  minutes for the drive worst case you are early and go get a cheesesteak or whatever folks do in philly to burn extra time
as a future heads up if you know you have a trip in advance and book at the right time you can get an amtrak ticket from dc to philly for as low as the sucky part is that you have to time it right because the prices fluctuate  weeks out seems to be the right time frame
no just a regular weekend traffic on  on a regular friday could be a bear even then extrapolating from that experience i think youll hit traffic going to philly and coming home tomorrow lots of people  in philly wilmington baltimore and dc will be on the road
i have a commitment in the mornig would have to have been there at  and couldnt leave earlier than 
yeah thats a sweet deal im aware this only popped up a few days ago however
because the council has effectively made it unnecessary to pay camera infractions the strategy is to to generate revenue by shotgunning out enough tickets that if even a tiny percentage of citizens are honest enough to pay their tickets the city still makes tons of money
no of course it wont because dc doesnt have reciprocity with any other state so drivers from md and va who get  of dcs automated enforcement tickets are under no legal obligation to pay them add  cameras if you want it will just stack up more uncollectable tickets and a bunch more on dc residents
the quoted sources about the lowest rate of traffic deaths is inaccurate their analysis says nothing about out of state drivers who frequent the district while we have roughly  vehicles registered in the district that nearly doubles when you account for commuters or others who drive into the district   as stated by others these cameras will only be worth while if we can enforce it
to be honest you do need cams in some places but a lot of cams in dc are just there to make money for example the camera on k street i feel that one just wants to catch people and the cams on both dc and i like who puts speeding cameras on freeways they just trying to milk people imo but cams in high pedestrian areas make sense
it will make the contractors who supply them rich
all i know is traffic on th street actually goes the speed limit because of the expensive speeding camera tickets and it would be nice if traffic always went that slowly around pedestrians
maybe they should focus on making the ones they have more effective for the md and va lunatics we have to share the road with
as a pedestrian who is almost run over by cars driving unsafely on a neardaily basis give me all the traffic enforcementpunishment you can
they cant tax you for speeding if you dont speed
thank you for posting this information i think the speed cameras in dc are excessively harsh and youve provided some good information to push back against them with our elected officials
 i drive i dont speed and i never get tickets  its not that difficult traffic is noticeably less aggressive in places where there are traffic cams there is nothing wrong with generating revenue from people who choose to put the rest of us at risk for their convenience
no
drug overdoses  homicide   traffic related deaths httpswwwcdcgovnchspressroomstatesdcdchtm
unless they boot and impound the cars with outstanding tickets this wont do a damn thing  the idiots on the council just decided to let people with all of these fines renew their licenses
this is highway robbery and indirect taxation in a disguise of rightousnous and safety
if you instal a dash cam like garmin it will let you know the location of all the cameras httpswwwgarmincomenusphttpswwwgarmincomenusp
they not only need more cameras but also to tie a license plate with a bank account so the fine can be automatically deducted from the checking account the only way enforcement works
the cams on wisconsin and connecticut are just taxes at this point
someone is going through and downvoting all my comment responses even the very general ones maybe they hate my hypothesis which is fine just offer up a comment of why if youre gonna downvote
just slow down as the traffic cams show up on waze
if they could just pave the damn roads   worse than driving in iraq
ive walked around a lot in dc and have never been close to being hit by an unsafe driver this feels like a completely made up problem
if you are a driver you know where speed cams are and you slow down in those areas then you know that speed cams do in fact get drivers to slow down the problem isnt that they dont work the problem is that they arent used to actually systematically change driver behavior they are just used to slow drivers down or generate revenue in a small number of targeted spots tripling cameras wont get there either but its a start  speeding cameras need to be everywhere they shouldnt be tripled there should be like  times as many you shouldnt be able to drive anywhere without passing multiple speed cameras then people will actually slow down especially if it is paired with real attempts to collect eg vastly expanded booting operations andor undoing the councils recent decision to let people with multiple outstanding speeding tickets keep renewing their licenses and registrationsi think this would help yes i also think it would help to actually transform the citys infrastructure to be much less carfriendly and if you do that you dont need the same sort of expansive enforcement regime but the status quo is unacceptable and we should do one or the other
i cant wait to move out of this area
no but it will cause more traffic because of people slowing down at one time  to avoid them
removed
yes the cameras should also randomly move and be mobile if people thought a camera could literally be anywhere they would drive safer
short answer no  long answer no
we also have some of the worst drivers in the country and they need to start using a lot more strategies to get it under control because our car insurance prices are insane ive been driving here since i was a teen and never gotten even one speed camera ticket it is possible to just drive the speed limit
we could get rid of the speed cameras if we made the reasonable choice to ban cars
i think congress just likes having a set amount they can pull fromedit they let off way more fines for foreign diplomats and family members plus that wealth doesnt even spread around the areas evenly
maybe if they also enforced payment
i fucking hate it here speed cameras are there to take money from the poor not to make the city saferespecially when you see how many cars are repeat offenders who never pay their tickets anyways
wont matter until dc hires more than  people to tow cars that have excess traffic violations and mdva also inforce fines
so traffic cams are a good safety tool i used to work in road safety  but putting them everywhere as a cash grab does not increase safety they seem to mostly put them where they can catch someone for the money
well seeing as how drivers in this city very nearly run over pedestrians every day in the crosswalks i think cars really should slow the fuck down literally almost hit every fucking day by a driver making a rightonred turn the aggressiveness from dc drivers is unmatched in other cities of this size
no
if the cameras and such were ineffective no one would complain about new ones
council loves helping asshole and careless law breakers
   because the council has effectively made it unnecessary to pay camera infractionscan you expound on this please
so does that mean you agree theyre not doing this to make it safer theyre doing this to make money
this i was in a rideshare the other day and when i told the driver of a speed camera coming up the driver said it wasnt a big deal as they had md plates then mentioned he had over  in speeding tickets all minor infractions because there is no reciprocity and therefore nothing compelling him to pay
well ya until they get booted in dc  this sub has been filled with pictures of people getting booted lately i assumed dc was upping their game in that regard    if not though then all youre doing is ticketing actual dc residence
or the military road camera at the bottom of the hill instead of at the top where the school actually is
k street cam is such a joke no pedestrians are even allowed down there
they dont get the money it goes towards the general fund
can you elaborate
im just wondering if tripling the cameras will actually make things safer
traffic enforcement is racist how many traffic stops end in a deadly result look at what happened in akron another innocent man dead because of what speeding look at the stats far more people die from traffic enforcement than pedestrians getting hit
this is mostly true but god forbid you go mph on connecticut ave at am i drove that everyday for a reverse commute and over two years got two tickets each for  in a  how can an empty  lane road be mph its a shameless money grab
but they can put a camera on every street corner and justify it in the name of public safety like they do in china
american as apple pie
im all for traffic safety i didnt have a car for almost  years living in dc i bike a ton around the city and walk a lot as well i cant even tell you the number of times ive seen people blow through red lightsbut that all being said i think the traffic camera system is problematicnfor several reasons the revenue goes to the general fund rather than improvemenrs to traffic infrastucuture sure some of it maybe  is spent on traffic safety improvements but if it were really about traffic safety theyd be spending a lot more  md and va drivers face no consequences for getting tickets and theyre the vast majority of reckless drivers theyre indiscriminate ive received  for going  in a  at am in an area with wide roads and no one on the streets at all seems excessively punitive to me
i dont speed either im a very careful driver but still get  tickets a year for  each and almost every time its mph in a  i couldnt hit that every time if i tried so i think some fuckery is going on but some are my fault as a momentary loss in focus and also because the speed limits go from  across the city and some cams are at the bottom of steep hills or the one on kenilworth that is right next to the highway onoff ramps around schools and pedestrian walkways these are fine but most are set up to make money not safety this is definitely one reason im looking forward to leaving this city
succinct and true
these stats are from 
thank you for actual stats
ok this is pretty epic i love when leaders ignore big problems to increase tax revenues in areas not really seen as a problem go politics
ya but thats not really the point why isnt the gov focusing on things that actually make it safer intead of things that make them more money   i used waze i just drove across  states and didnt hear one traffic cam ahead until i hit the dmv  then it happened every  minutes it was like a joke from a sitcom
people probably dislike your shitty post because dcs streets are dangerous and all you have to do to avoid a speeding ticket if to drive at the posted speed limit
have an upvote i agree that more cameras are just another way to tax residents and not tackle larger issues
thats because this subreddit is anti car regardless of the argument
i heard mass ave is just  to  years from being fimished
same
i agree
probably more effective to put speed bumps everywhere  out cut outs in the bumps for buses people might get so sick of the bumps they start to take the bus and metro instead
the average driver spends  hours a year in traffic in dc its  hours a yearhttpswwwgilmanbedigiancomcarcrashfactsstatisticsindc
hahahaha
huh
i always pay them even though i live in md i know that one day it will come back to haunt me if i dont take care of it
depends on what you mean by effective  does effective mean making the roads safer or does effective mean making more money for the gov
there are no repercussions for not paying traffic camera tickets again the average law abiding citizen is negatively affected by current city council policies
yeah  in dcs case its definitely revenue generating which is a shame because theres good data showing that if implemented correctly passive enforcement can reduce accidents and unsafe driving however this requires judicious placement of cameras and an actual enforcement mechanism for repeat offendersdc places their cameras where theyre likely to catch people speeding not necessarily in spots where enforcement is really needed  for example near my house theres a camera at the bottom of a hill on a four lane thoroughfare that is technically residential because there are some houses on it the design of the street encourages people to drive above the posted speed limit and the placement of the camera at the bottom of a steep slope makes it all the more likely that people will be going above speed when they pass the camera   theres another camera on an access road on  that for some inexplicable reason is mph but the speed markings are extremely unclear again the design of the road encourages speeding and its not really in an area where enforcement is badly needed  both of these cameras feel like traps im sure they generate tons of revenue for the city but theyre not near pedestrian heavy areas of schools or the likecouple this with the lack of enforcement  no reciprocity with md or va no requirement to pay violations to renew your license not collections for over due tickets barely any booting or towing  and theres virtually no incentive to pay attention to cameras sure  maaaaybe youll get towed but its pretty unlikely people regularly wrack up k worth of tickets and face no consequences like i said it feels like the city is playing a numbers game blast out tons of tickets and if even a small percentage pay up its big money but the people that pay arent the regular repeat offenders
not op but yes that was always the plan with speed cameras if the city really cared they would make changes to roadways like narrowing them creating bump outs more speed humps creating pedonly streets etc speed cameras are purely a band aid and the preferred band aid at that because the city can line its pockets whilst signing off on multi million dollar contracts with the camera installation and maintenance companies
minor infractions are their words because you dont get a ticket unless youre going mph over the speed limit
there are  outstanding tickets from md and va there are  bootable vehicles from those two states and dc has  boot crews who have been getting about  a day but some of them are dc residents too the number of people they are getting is a rounding error
i know right plus youre naturally going faster because of that little decline in the road just a absolute joke
how are people this stupid theres pedestrians on either end of the tunnel the excuses you people make to speed with impunity are incredible
they get the money to install them
according to this md and va drivershttpswwwwusacomarticlenewsverifysomestatesdonotpunishtheirdriversforoutofstateinfractionsffccbfccedfbdf are practically exempt from camerabased tickets im guessing op means that this lack of enforcement makes them more likely to ignore red lights and speed limits	by now you probably heard about the loophole where drivers from maryland and virginia dont have to pay penalties from speed and redlight cameras in dc it is because the three areas havent come to a reciprocity deal
ujamesda beat me to it i also think they should have a bounty system where the booting team can crowd source leads on the locations of cars with the highest amount of unpaid tickets so they can prioritize the most flagrant offenders
i see cars driving slower around speeding cameras at slower speeds collisions become less deadly seems pretty conclusive to me
no its a money grab thats what mrs bowser is good at her personal wealth went from m to m in her first term guess her reelection made her wonder how she could do that for the district which i guess is a step in the right direction but also bandaids for all
one argument for cameras is that they penalize speeding without police interactions
can we consider connecticut avenue i live on connecticut avenue very close to where some fellow who shouldnt have been driving lost control of his suv and killed two women trying to have lunch on an unseasonably warm winter day but connecticut avenue a six lane road which primarily passes apartments condominiums and small commercial strips which is often clogged with personal commercial traffic including many delivery vehicles small and giant and transit buses which features signaled and nonsignaled intersections and crosswalks every few hundred feet and goodness i even forgot the bicyclists and all the construction projects i dont know thirty miles per hour seems reasonable would you be happier if the camera didnt kick in until you were doing   like where do you draw the line at what a reasonable speed would be what if the reasonable speed is  miles an hour but what happens to a speeding car on connecticut ave if hypothetically the driver loses control at  mph and goes flying into a restaurant or a ground level apartment or condo and what would have happened if that same driver was only doing  mph or  doing some math  assuming you drove this commute five times a week for  weeks out of the year took out  for vacation holidays etc rounded up that means your ticket avoidance rate is  sounds pretty good
do you ever walk with children bike or do stuff outside of a car in dcspeeding is a terror it killsmaims people and its got to stop
theres already cameras on most street corners in this city
want some cheese with all the whine
we live in a city  there is never no one on the streets  the fine is supposed to be punitive its literally a punishment
are you proposing we increase speed limits at night despite there being significantly lower visibility and more intoxicated drivers
i dont speed either im a very careful driverokbut still get  tickets a year for  eachhmmm yesand almost every time its mph in a sir that is speeding
all these downvotes are we the only people that dont like the cameras and think money could be allocated to things that actually make a difference
please dont feel insecure about your opinion and think you need to hurl insults to get it across let it stand on its own youve got some great points  i think youre ignoring the point of the post though  its not about getting out of speeding tickets its about how dc has the most speeding cameras and the most fines of any city by your own admission the streets are still dangerous so why are we tripling the number of cameras  if like you say the streets arent any safer then why are our elected officials focusing on something that doesnt make the streets safer
awe thanks  back to  on the post
your link also says dc has much fewer traffic deaths than our neighbors
whut
so if a dc resident ignores tickets from cameras there are zero repercussions  im just making sure i understand this correctly
thats the part i dont like people with k much less k in speeding tickets have no business driving they need to get tougher on the recklessness and not just let up all the time when people are irresponsible
likely to catch people speeding literally means likely to catch people breaking the law
the boots are use for parking violationsred light and speed camera violations have no teeth as there is no assessment of points on driving records the reason why is because camera violations are issued to vehicle registration tag and not to drivers license
cars have brakes
deleted
you have to drive dangerously slow to avoid this camera in addition to your comment being very dumb it also comes off rude as fuck
oh ya i figured they were closing that loophole by adding a lot more dc enforcement ive been seeing all the posts where drivers are getting booted in dc
but im talking about connecticut ave where the cameras are well north of friendship heights between the circle and east west highway theres literally zero foot traffic one school that has a crossing guard and a traffic light and lets be honest these are che y chase kids who do not walk to school there are few intersections is a straight line its empty yet has a speed camera  its a shameless money grab almost as bad as the military road camera by st johnsedit i guess my real gripe isnt the speed camera its the speed limit  is too slow for a road that was built for  but by using a camera you actually get enforcement of an arbitrary speed limit the road must be altered to match the speed limit before punishing people for traveling a safe speed that is higher than the posted number
until they address the bikeratv gangs that dont even stop for red lights i think they have bigger issues to deal with
ah ok thanks for letting me know its not worth conversing with you constructively
its silly to say there is never no one on the streets do you sincerely believe theres people or cars out on every street at every hour this isnt nyc ive driven  miles in the last  months mostly in dc at all hours snd biked thousands of miles around the city at all hours i have a pretty good sense of the traffic patterns theres often totally empty streets in the middle of the night on weeknights especially in more residential areasand i get that its meant to be punitive but there could still be some scale like a warning for st offense  for lower speeds higher fines for running reds etcno one is at risk from me going  down th street at am on a tuesday
yes people love paying more money to their governments for less results its actually a crazy psychological phenomena
yeah i have great points because you dont have any dc doesnt have ticket reciprocity for automated enforcement so most of the tickets it issues are irrelevant again people like you are mad youre required to go the speed limit thats the only thing youre upset about
yes correct
what does congress have to do with it
under the law that was just passed i dont think it has been signed by the mayor yet you can still renew your license if you have unpaid tickets i think the only potential penalty is your car being booted
technically you could be booted and towed if you owe above a certain amount however the towing team is small and its pretty uncommon that people even people with k worth of tickets get towedbut the city wont send delinquents to collections theres no points system and you can renew your license even if youve got lots of unpaid tickets
id honestly be ok with the law if it were limited to nonmoving violations buuuut its not because its easier to pander to idiots that dont want to pay speeding tickets than it is to worry about people dying on the road way
if all you care about is enforcement of the law then sure  creating silly speed traps that catch people that are technically in violation of the law is great id argue that a four lane mph residential thoroughfare is a fundamentally flawed concept that a speeding camera cant possibly fix id also argue than an service road with dog shit signage that forces people exiting the highway to slow from mph to mph in  feet is similarly flawed and wont be fixed by a traffic camera furthermore neither of these areas are particularly dangerous trafficwise so id question what problem the city is even trying to address by placing cameras therecouple this with the fact that there are areas that automated enforcement could actually make safer near parks schools pedestrianbike thoroughfares etc but they arent targeted by the city for enforcement because they probably wouldnt generate a huge number of tickets
really i didnt
removed
yeah imagine the audacity of the city to make drivers travel at  mph in a dense urban area just before encountering multiple crosswalks can you believe they dont just let selfish assholes like you bomb through the neighborhood with total disregard for pedestrian safety
wtf is dangerously slow when its the posted speed limit
maybe im confused isnt that maryland
that you are not capable of constructive conversation was communicated with your nonsense about in the name of public safety like they do in china same reason why people ranting about militant cyclists and wars on cars drivers or both arent worth my time
i can see that youre one of those people who dont like to engage in conversation so ill oblige you
there are cameras which have ridiculously low speeds which create extremely dangerous conditions you get half the drivers going  to avoid the ticket on a road where the appropriate speed is probably  and the other half going what should be the posted speed limit and it creates danger for all involved if it was about safety they wouldnt use cameras which create danger its about money so people are justifiably upset
diplomatic immunity and just forgiving politicians is a big reason they keep over taxing people who live and work in dc imo to recoup a ton of lost funds they will never get back from places like russiaalso when dc council and mayor decide the budget it has to then go to both potus and congress they can decide what they think is best these two things together i think make it where the city is always thinking of adding to the budget because it helps  they come down on the residents because so many others are skating costs but roads gotta be paved
gotcha  thanks
weve all gotten confused in parking tickets but people drive like maniacs and then have the nerve to complain when insurance i our area is high
removed
yeah this cam is on an expressway where no pedestrians are allowed if they want to put speeding cams near the pedestrian areas go for it but putting them on highways where the safe speed is above the posted speed limit they are knowingly creating dangerous conditions
great question this is what a large body of traffic science revolves around there is a very popular idea in traffic science called the th percentile rule to use someone elses words the institute of transportation engineers defines this as the speed at or below which  percent of vehicles travel in other words the speed limit on these roads would be set at a freeflowing traffic speed at which only around  percent of typical drivers would exceed and violate much of this theory is based on multiple studies which show that basically the majority of drivers will drive at a speed they feel most comfortablesafe at regardless of the posted speed limit  google scholar can be weird with links but there should be about  related studies if you swipe to the right httpsscholargooglecomscholarhlenassdtcqdriveatspeedsregardlessoflimitsbtngdgsqabstupdksffbemjhuej  so if the posted speed limit is way lower than what the average driver would feel is the ideal safe speeds conditions are created where there are large disparaties in speed and these disparities are what often lead to accidents and pedestrian deaths this is a very exaggerated example but imagine if we switched the speed limit on  to mph or a larger road like constitution ave nw to mph it may seem to some that this would make things safer in reality you would have most cars driving at the actual safest cruising speed and a few others going way slower essentially creating the formula for a crash so in short its more that the posted speed limit itself is dangerously slow here is a really good op ed which explains it better than i lolhttpsreasonorgcommentarydolowerspeedlimitsmakeroadwayssafer
the  makes sense to me from chevy chase circle north until whenever the lanes widen which i think is eastwest or maybe a bit south of that i think they start widening out around the golf course and the road itself opens up to mph around the fire station or not far past it i think i thought you were talking about ct ave in dc proper
if you wanna hurl insults then its obvious you dont want a constructive conversation dont be angry that i dont want to waste my time when im making genuine points and youre playing elementary school games i dont have time for you anymore not even in my leisure reddit time
youre so wrong its actually laughable if the streets arent safe and we already have the most cameras then we need to have more because they obviously havent started working yet forget about those who dont pay or dont have tagsdrive illegal vehicles make the law abiders pay more epic
removed
the camera on k st is not a highway maybe you think it is but it isnt
yeah ive read those none of them indicate driving the posted speed limit is dangerous unless youre saying  of people speed there in which just isnt true and is easily addressablealso great quoting a libertarian think tank op ed which quotes the automotive lobby
okay dude just remember when you speed youre giving yourself traffic tickets cry about china all you want
were talking about the one that is on the whitehurst freeway towards the k st exit right
yeah no one is saying that driving the speed limit is inherently dangerous  were saying that having speed limits well below the design limits of a streetroad is inherently dangerous in a perfect world people would never exceed the limit even if its a dangerously slow limit but basing traffic policy on the logic that everyone will follow the rules and no one has ever and will ever exceed a speed limit is not just dumb but also encourages more pedestrian deaths and in my opinion more pedestrian deathsaccidents is bad so we should encourage policy which limits pedestrian deaths instead of increasing it it was determined that speed variance will approach minimum values if the posted speed limit is between  and  mph lower than the design speed outside this range speed variance increases with an increasing difference between the design speed and the posted speed limit it was also found that drivers tend to drive at increasing speeds as the roadway geometric characteristics improve regardless of the posted speed limit and that accident rates do not necessarily increase with an increase in average speed but do increase with an increase in speed variance
i think you just want the last word
yes its literally in front of a crosswalk
if youre worried about people driving faster than the speed limit you can add a traffic slowing feature like i dont know a speed camera i joke but thats what they are there for you can also use road features like speed bumps and the like taking a libertarian think tank and the automotive lobbys advice on the matter is probably not a great idea though
you son of a bitch your psychological warfare worked and im back
get it son
not everyone has the luxury to drive a brand new well maintained car that pos car may be their only mode of transportation they were also probably on their way to a shit job in the district what frustrates me are the super speeders and reckless drivers that cause accidents
you arent in traffic you are traffic you have plenty of alternatives metro marc vre commuter bus because you arent taking these you are contributing to the very problem you are complaining about take responsibility for your own actions
deleted
i think its been difficult for a variety of reasons for people to do necessary routine maintenance on their cars recently be it financial reasons or just supply chain issues i think people have been forgoing maintenance i know youre having a frustrating morning but just something to keep in mind
this must be satire  well played op
infrastructure of roads and highways is whats causing the traffic dc was not built to handle it so here we are this is why i take vremetro now but not everyone has that option
i am the traffic
how about you start by not being part of the problem  take public transportation instead of driving and creating traffic yourself we look forward to your public transportation rant next and the woes of those poors on it having already heard the woes of the car driving traffic creating poors
the reliance on cars is so sad
i blame the highway layout and city design more than people so much of traffic is caused by shitty merging areas few major roads etc it sometimes feels like dc has not evolved properly like other major us cities to allow for an increase in drivers and traffic there are definitely some bad drivers here but i ultimately think its a layout problem that will be never be solved until they figure out how to efficiently redirect most cross city traffic
whos gonna tell them 
shitty cars on  are the least of the traffic problems in dc was on a bike for fun i sat at th and mass yesterday during afternoon rush hour eastbound mass traffic did a full block the box three light cycles in a row thought people were going to start shooting lol
pretty sure there is some decent research showing driving slower than other traffic causes more accidents than speeding interestingly enough it causes excesses braking lane changes and exacerbated aggressive actions by other drivers
nobody says it has to be brand new but if you know your car has issues dont drive it on a major effing highway and if you do and it breaks down there needs to be some accountability especially if the law is to move over for every stalled vehicle now its ridiculous
i wouldnt have a problem if all these other people werent on the road
i have taken the marc and metro many times and each time i was late for work because of delays it also is a  plus hour commute using those methods where as driving is not lmao at commuter bus you clearly have no idea what youre talking about
hey i chose to live in the burbs during covid and now its inconvenient i blame everyone else but me
dont pin this on dc this is simply peak selfentitled asshole
again nobody said brand new the stupidity in these responses is crazy lol who said anything about lower class such a dc liberal response so youre fine with people driving around  lb death machines that are not maintained because theyre poor makes zero sense
 it sometimes feels like dc has not evolved properly like other major us cities to allow for an increase in drivers and trafficmany of us would not consider that to be a form of evolution the contrary really
sure but driving slower than other traffic here means at least  when the speed limit is  so should we all drive  mph or
it causes excessive breaking because the people stopping are breaking the law id rather have everyone go slower than the positive feedback loop that is the beltway
i really wish we had advanced highway system and cars where in order to get entry your car passes a sensor that reports if there are major faults the car then gets blocked from entering road and diverted part of the issue is that yearly safety inspections have been done away with due to costs and liberal whining that it creates a financial burden on the poor
except i mentioned specific drivers
leave earlier why dont you
not my fault you made poor choices
lol except i said in the op that i didnt choose to live out of dc unlike your privileged ass i cant afford to live in the city
lol entitled because i think people who break down or get into accidents need to be held accountable for everyone else have to waste time and gas ok green girl well just keep pretending like you riding a bike to work and using soy bags for your groceries actually helps deal with climate change eh definition of peak dc asshole there
deleted
yes it would be better if cities evolved to have better clean transit bikingwalking ease and overall better mobility but since cars still exist it would definitely be a form of evolution to figure out the most efficient way to get drivers around while also reducing serious accidentsenvironmental pollution caused by idling in traffic
i dont believe i said that but statistically speaking the opposite of what this person claims is actually true ideally everyone would be driving roughly the same speed regardless of what that was
they are struggling to even expand highways in md i doubt something like that would ever be possible va has the right idea with just making everything toll roads just need congestion pricing in dc proper and the people who cant afford to break down on the road will think twice about driving
no you mentioned people getting into accidents out of their control unless speedingdriving recklessly and people breaking down also out of their control so what behavior are you asking people to change
have you driven in the area there is traffic at any time if its not idiots getting into accidents there will be construction or litter clean up or xyz
lmao poor choices like having a family and needing more than a one bedroom apartment in dc for k a month yeah poor choice
all of the rich people and leadership at every white collar job ive had in dc live in nova or maryland and drive into the  a day parking garageanecdotally my coworkers in midmanagement and below all take transit a lot of vre and marc riders but a few bus and metro folks tooyou do get a pretax benefitsubsidythe door folks cleaners and maintenance workers in my building almost all take bus or metro or carpool with familyoutside of the lead maintenance guy with a work truck
theres plenty of folks living in dc at all price points
i said nothing about lower class pos cars does not imply lower class you elitist it implies people who dont maintain their car and knowingly drive it on a major highway dipshit i didnt call you a liberal i said your response was also please show me where i was shitting all over the marc learn to read better youre clearly triggered by my comments not sure why are you actually a snowflake yourself
um theres a reason why walkable and annoying to drive in almost always go in hand
those are specific drivers im not sure what youre trying to refute here the definition of specific lol
lmao i meant leave earlier when taking public transportation
weird i bought a br house in dc and my monthly payment is way less than that you made your choices
find a job closer to home or a remote job  wont have to deal with traffic again
because dc is well known for its affordable and abundant housing lol

i think you can do both i dont think the solution to transportation is to eliminate all accessible roads for cars and revert back to walking places
leave earlier to do what hang out at my job and not get paid is this how people really think
im calling bs unless you live in the hood in which case youre comparing apples to oranges i guess its too much to ask to want an affordable place thats safe and near good schools nowadays
yeah its that easy dude leave a job youve been at for  years and find a new one closer to you talk about privilege
tldr all i got from the comments is that surprise a thread about how shitty dc traffic is for commuters isnt well received by people who live on dc what a shock the interesting thing is how quick people in dc are to stereotype bad car automatically  poor got it lol
youve obviously never driven here and it shows lol
no ones suggesting that but so far weve built dc to accommodate cars more than people and the solution isnt to do that even more
deleted
like i said you made your choices just because youre privileged and think youre too good to live somewhere doesnt mean we should go out of our way to accommodate those choices

if i were you take the metroamtrak to dc public transportation uberlyft is the worstcase scenario traffic hasnt changed much imo the only way driving to dc makes sense to me is if you have someone else dropping you off or carsitting as you go do your thing lol
i would not arrive during rush hour am or so and pm or so  its not as bad as it was prepandemic but its definitely getting worse and worse
you dont need a car in dc metro and lyft and scootersbicycles are all you needthe interstate corridor between richmond and dc is  a traffic catastrophe
metro ridership is still way down but car traffic is almost as bad as it was before the pandemic   easily  plus of rush hour traffic is maryland and virginia plates
heck no still traffic mondaysaturday during am and pm rush hour also i traveling in or out of dc is a nightmare
park at metro and use metro busses citybike from there there are apps like citymapper that will tell you how to get from point a to point b easily without a carremember when youre driving and traffic is bad youre part of why its bad
arrive between the hours of  am  pm or  pm onwardsany other time and youre going to be stuck in traffic or if youre unlucky and theres the usual accidents on the beltway it may be even longeri used to drive to work from dc to sterling va at around  am because i refuse to waste  hours of my life per day driving fortunately i dont have to go to an office anymore
traffic did decrease back then but has steadily been getting worse and worse as people return to work the biggest key ive found is make sure you use waze everytime and just follow it even if it doesnt make sense it knows something you dont
traffic here has always sucked depending on where youre coming from some routes are worse than others coming north on  is probably the worst coming  south isnt too bad until you hit  from the west  can be friend or foe helps if you have a passenger
theres no reason to drive a car in dc
traffic is still bad plus depending on how far out you are staying theres toll roads to keep in mind as others have mentioned the metro and lyft are better than driving while in the city we also have scooters and bike sharing for short distance travel in the city a car isnt necessary for traversing downtown or getting anywhere in most of dc id only worry about bringing a car if im commuting from maryland or virginia to a part of dc that isnt metro accessible even then metro  scooter can get you there
i live in dc and definitely need a car wouldnt be able to get to work otherwise
tell me you live in ward    without etc
yeah im driving in from ohio and will be staying in the national mall car will at minimum be needed to get into town and to the hotel
tell me you live in ward  you definitely want a car and will have zero problem parking free in ward 
you could drive to a metro station in the suburbs park there and take metro in it will be cheaper and less stressfulalso you can stay near the mall but not in it its a green areapark with no buildings the buildings considered on the mall are basically just museums
