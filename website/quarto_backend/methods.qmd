## Methods

### 1. How is walkabilty associated with socioeconomic outcomes in Washington, D.C.?

#### 1.1 Data Collection

#### 1.2 Data Cleaning

#### 1.3 Data Visualization

Using the Pandas, Geopandas, and Altair libraries, we generated an interactive visualization of walkability and socio-economic outcomes in Washington, D.C. First, we normalized the walkability scores to a range of 0 to 100 so that the scores are more intuitive to the audience. Then, we conducted some basic data, including converting missing or negative values to NaN values, renaming columns, and melting data. To generate the interactive visualization, we used the Altair library to create a bar chart with tract or neighborhood names on the x-axis, variable names on the y-axis, and variable values as the bar heights. We further aggregate the data at the national level by calculating the average of the variable values for all neighborhoods, and store the aggregated data in a separate dataframe.

### 2. How is walkability associated with health outcomes in Washington, D.C.?

#### 2.1 Data Collection

We obtained PLACES Census Health Data Estimation data. This dataset contains model-based census tract level estimates for PLACES 2022 release. PLACES covers the entire United States at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. The estimates, on the other hand, are provided by CDC's Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The data sources used are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020/2019, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 estimates. 29 of these measures were mapped at the census tract level using GIS systems.

#### 2.2 Data Cleaning and Exploration

We first read in the PLACES Census Tract Data and conduct some basic cleaning, such as selecting only data related to Washington, D.C. and renaming columns. Then, to do some basic data exploration, we created an exploratory scatter plot using Plotly, where we can examine the relationship between pairs of user-selected health outcomes in D.C. on the x-axis and y-axis. We used a callback function, update_visibility, to update the visibility of the scatter plot traces based on the selected values from the drop-down menus.

```


#### 2.3 Data Visualization 

Based on this we created a second graph where we explore the relationship between walkability and health outcomes. We created two drop-down menus using Plotly's dcc.Dropdown. The selected values from the drop-down menus are passed to the update_visibility function, which then updates the scatter plot based on the selected health metrics. We then displayed the final plot using Plotly's dcc.Graph.



### 3. How accessible are neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. by bike?

#### 3.1 Data Collection

Bike lanes and the Capital Bikeshare program are two major initiatives for improving quality of life and transportation access in D.C. by the D.C. Department of Transportation. Since these two initiatives go hand in hand, we decided to analyze them together in a single visualization. For this analysis we collected the following datasets:

- [**Capital Bikeshare Trip Data for March 2023**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html): This dataset compiles all of the Capital Bikeshare trips completed by riders in the Washington D.C. metro area. It contains information such as `start_at`: starting bike dock, `ended_at`: ending bike dock, `start_station_name`: street name information for starting dock station, `end_station_name`: street name information for end dock station. It also includes the latitude and longitude information for the start and end locations of the rider's trip.
- [**U.S. Census Tract D.C. GeoJSON**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcee123/GIS_GEOJSON_CENSUS_TRACTS/master/11.geojson): This file is the GeoJSON map file created by the U.S. Census Bureau for Washington, D.C.. It includes a geographical information regarding the location of each neighborhood in Washington, D.C.
- [**Open Data DC Bike Lane GeoJSON**](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::bicycle-lanes/explore?location=38.877487%2C-76.976765%2C12.88): This GeoJSON file provided by the D.C. Government provides geographical information regarding the various bike lanes located throughout the city.

#### 3.2 Data Cleaning

Since the goal of this visualization was the show both the bike lane and bikeshare data on a single map, we cleaned the datasets to put them in the proper format. In the Capital Bikeshare dataset, each trip's latitude and longitude was recorded from the point where the bike was activated at the dock. This meant that even though various rides started at the same bike dock, there were small variations in the recorded latitudes and longitudes. Thereforem, the latitude and longitude values were standardized for each bike station. Additionally, the bikeshare dataset contained data for the entire Washington D.C. metro area and since we focused our analysis to D.C. only, stations outside of the D.C. boundary were removed. Finally, any rows with incomplete trip values were removed. 

The GeoJSON files did not undergo any processing and therefore were used as-is.

bikeshare_df = pd.read_csv(data_dir/"202303-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.csv")

# Convert dates into datetime format
bikeshare_df['started_at'] = pd.to_datetime(bikeshare_df['started_at'])
bikeshare_df['ended_at'] = pd.to_datetime(bikeshare_df['ended_at'])

# Drop rides with NaN values
bikeshare_df.dropna(subset=['start_station_name'], inplace = True)
bikeshare_df.dropna(subset=['end_station_name'], inplace = True)

# Standardize longitude and latitude using start station
bikeshare_df['start_lng'] = bikeshare_df['start_lng'].groupby(bikeshare_df['start_station_id']).transform('max')
bikeshare_df['start_lat'] = bikeshare_df['start_lat'].groupby(bikeshare_df['start_station_id']).transform('max')

# Create dataframe for joining
tmp = bikeshare_df[['start_station_id', 'start_lng','start_lat']]
tmp.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)

# Merge using the common station id value
bikeshare_df = bikeshare_df.merge(tmp, left_on = 'end_station_id', right_on = 'start_station_id')

# Drop repeated columns and rename them
bikeshare_df.drop(columns = ['end_lat', 'end_lng', 'start_station_id_y'], inplace = True)
bikeshare_df.rename(columns = {'start_lat_x': 'start_lat', 'start_lng_x': 'start_lng', 'start_lat_y': 'end_lat', 'start_lng_y':'end_lng', 'start_station_id_x': 'start_station_id'}, inplace = True)
bikeshare_df.to_csv(Path().absolute().parent.absolute().parent/"data/cleaned_data/bikeshare_cleaned.csv", index = False)
```


#### 3.3 Data Visualization

In the `Altair` plot, we combined March 2023 Capital Bikeshare Data with D.C. geographical data to create a layered visual. The geographical layout is a map of D.C. with each neighborhood outlined by white. Each point represents a Capital Bikeshare Station with the size representing the amount of trips starting from that station in the month of March. The yellow lines represent the bike lanes created by the D.C. government on public streets. When the user hovers over any station, the visual will show black network lines (or edges) that connect that station ("start" station) to other stations ("end" stations), representing where people have traveled to with the Capital Bikeshare bikes. We also included tooltips that display the station information and appear when a user hovers over a station.

### 4. What is metro ridership in Washington, D.C. like?

#### 4.1 Data Collection

To obtain information about metro ridership, we went to WMATA, which has its own ridership data portal. The data is collected from the Metrorail Ridership Year-over-Year Change dashboard [here](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/ridership-portal/Metrorail-Ridership-Year-over-Year-Change.cfm). Only data for March 2023 is available, so then we went to the download button in the bottom right corner of the platform to downoload this data. For more information about the data collection method, please reach out to "planning_ridership@wmata.com".

#### 4.2 Data Cleaning

In answering this question, we built an interactive timeseries plot of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Metro entries by selected station and date in March 2023 using the Plotly library. Then, we cleaned the data by renaming the 'Date_This_Year' and 'Entry_This_Year' columns to 'Date' and 'Entries' respectively for clarity. We also pivoted the dataframe so that number of entries are shown by station in columns and date in rows. Then, we converted the index column, which contains the dates, to datetime format. We also organized the index from earliest to latest date. Finally, we selected the stations Anacostia, Stadium-Armory, Van Ness-UDC, Shaw-Howard Univ, Gallery Place, and Capitol South from the dataframe because the first three neighborhoods correspond to three of the least walkable neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. and the last three neighborhoods correspond to the most walkable neighborhoods. Otherwise, if we included all stations' data, the plot would be too crowded and confusing. We saved the cleaned data to a csv file.

```{python}
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Read in data
df = pd.read_csv('../../data/wmata.csv', encoding='utf-16', delimiter="\t")

# Remove columns Servicetype_This_Year(group), Holiday_Last_Year, Holiday_This_Year, Servicetype_This_Year, Time_Period, and Date_Last_Year
df = df.drop(['Day_of_Date_This_Year', 'Servicetype_This_Year_(group)', 'Holiday_Last_Year', 'Holiday_This_Year', 'Servicetype_This_Year', 'Time_Period', 'Date_Last_Year', 'Entries_Last_Year'], axis=1)

# Rename columns 
df = df.rename(columns={'Date_This_Year': 'Date'})
df = df.rename(columns={'Entries_This_Year': 'Entries'})

# Pivot data
pivot_df = df.pivot_table(index='Date', columns='Station', values='Entries')

# Convert index of pivot_df to datetime
pivot_df.index = pd.to_datetime(pivot_df.index)

# Organize index of pivot_df from earliest to latest date
pivot_df = pivot_df.sort_index()

# Select stations Anacostia, Stadium-Armory, Van Ness-UDC, Shaw-Howard Univ, Gallery Place, and Capitol South from pivot_df
new_df = pivot_df[['Anacostia', 'Stadium-Armory', 'Van Ness-UDC', 'Shaw-Howard U', 'Gallery Place', 'Capitol South']]


# Save pivot_df and new_df to csv
pivot_df.to_csv('../../data/cleaned_data/wmata_cleaned.csv')
new_df.to_csv('../../data/cleaned_data/wmata_new_cleaned.csv')
```


#### 4.3 Data Visualization

Using the cleaned data, we built an interactive time series plot using the plotly.graph_objects and plotly.subplots libraries. We read in the cleaned data (wmata_new_cleaned.csv) and created a list of all the unique station names in the dataset. We created a subplot with one trace per station and used a for loop to iterate through each unique station in the dataset, adding the corresponding trace to the subplot. Then, we created a dropdown menu to allow users to input a station from the list of stations available. Each station is represented in a button. When a user picks a station by selecting the corresponding button, the method updates the visibility of the trace to reflect the entries by day at the selected station. The layout of the plot is updated to include the dropdown menu and to set the title, axis labels, and fixed axis ranges. The fig.show() method to display the plot.

### 5. What is public sentiment around walkability in Washington, D.C.? 

#### 5.1 Data Collection

#### 5.2 Data Cleaning

#### 5.3 Data Visualization

We generated visualizations using Plotly library in Python to analyze sentiment polarity of comments related to different categories (bike, walk, and car). We first load and clean data from three different CSV files (b_sent.csv, c_sent.csv, and w_sent.csv) which contain sentiment analysis results for reddit comments related to bikes, cars, and walking, respectively. Next, we create three box plots using Plotly, one for each category of transport. We plotted the sentiment polarity values on the y-axis, and the categories on the x-axis. After the first graph, we create a 2D histogram contour plot and two more histograms. The contour plot (trace2) shows the density of sentiment polarity values for each category, with darker areas indicating higher density. The two histograms (trace3 and trace4) show the distribution of sentiment polarity values along the x-axis and categories along the y-axis separately. The final visualizations provide insights into the sentiment polarity of comments related to different categories, allowing for a comparison of sentiment distribution across categories.
