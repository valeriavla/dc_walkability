# ANLY 503 Project Repo

This is the team repository you will be use for your 503 project. All your team's work will happen here. 

Links of interest:
* The project requirements are in the [`instructions.md`](instructions.md) document
* The repository structure is described in the [reposity structure section](#repository-structure) below
* You **will** make changes to this `README.md` file within your repository. These changes are descripned in the [instructions section](#instructions-for-modifying-this-readmemd-file) below.

## Repository structure

You will work within an **organized** repository and apply coding and development best practices. The repository has the following structure:

```.
├── README.md
├── code/
├── data/
├── img/
└── website/
```

* The `code/` directory is where you will develop all your code.  You may add additional sub-directories as needed to modularize your development.

* The `data/` directory should contain your data files and should have multiple sub-directories (i.e. raw, processed, analytical, etc.) as needed.

* The `img/` directory should contain any external images that you need for your site. However, all your viz's should be generated programmatically in your source code.

* The `website/` directory where the website will be deployed. It must be self-contained and accessible via an index.html within this sub-directory.  Any website asset (images, html, css, JavaScript source code) must be added to this directory. 

There is an empty placeholder file in each subdirectory called `placeholder-to-be-deleted.txt`. This file may be deleted **after** you save other files in those subdirectories. This file is needed to be able to keep the empty directory in the repo.

Other files we expect to see at the top level of this repo may include:
- `.gitignore`


## Instructions for modifying this `README.md` file

The README.md file in a repository usually contains additional information about your project. Currently this file contains information about the repository structure. However, for the wip and final submissions, you will make the following changes to this file:

* You can delete the current content of the `README.md` file
* Add a project title section
* Add your team section with your team number and team member names
* Add an executive summary section describing your project
* Provide a description of all your code files, datasets, etc.
