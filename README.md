## Executive Summary 

Walkability is the ease with which people can access amenities in a place without the use of cars. It is associated with positive outcomes in health, community, sustainability, and the economy. A report by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy evaluated the walkability of major global cities and the only city to make the top 25 in any category was Washington, D.C. This project aims to provide a visual narrative that overviews the *walks through* the following research questions:

Research Questions:

1. How is walkability associated with socioeconomic and health outcomes?
2. How accessible are neighborhoods by bike?
3. What is public sentiment around walkability and driving
