case early go get cheesesteak whatever folks philly burn extra time future heads know trip advance book right time get amtrak ticket philly low sucky part time right prices fluctuate weeks seems right time frame regular weekend traffic regular friday could bear even extrapolating experience think youll hit traffic going philly coming home tomorrow lots people philly wilmington baltimore road commitment mornig couldnt leave earlier yeah thats sweet deal aware popped days ago however council effectively made unnecessary pay camera infractions strategy generate revenue shotgunning enough tickets even tiny percentage citizens honest enough pay tickets city still makes tons money course wont doesnt reciprocity state drivers md va get dcs automated enforcement tickets legal obligation pay add cameras want stack uncollectable tickets bunch residents quoted sources lowest rate traffic deaths inaccurate analysis says nothing state drivers frequent district roughly vehicles registered district nearly doubles account commuters others drive district stated others cameras worth enforce honest need cams places lot cams make money example camera k street feel one wants catch people cams like puts speeding cameras freeways trying milk people imo cams high pedestrian areas make sense make contractors supply rich know traffic th street actually goes speed limit expensive speeding camera tickets nice traffic always went slowly around pedestrians maybe focus making ones effective md va lunatics share road pedestrian almost run cars driving unsafely neardaily basis give traffic enforcementpunishment cant tax speeding speed thank posting information think speed cameras excessively harsh provided good information push back elected officials drive speed never get tickets difficult traffic noticeably less aggressive places traffic cams nothing wrong generating revenue people choose put rest us risk convenience drug overdoses homicide traffic related deaths httpswwwcdcgovnchspressroomstatesdcdchtm unless boot impound cars outstanding tickets wont damn thing idiots council decided let people fines renew licenses highway robbery indirect taxation disguise

cams show waze could pave damn roads worse driving iraq walked around lot never close hit unsafe driver feels like completely made problem driver know speed cams slow areas know speed cams fact get drivers slow problem isnt work problem arent used actually systematically change driver behavior used slow drivers generate revenue small number targeted spots tripling cameras wont get either start speeding cameras need everywhere shouldnt tripled like times many shouldnt able drive anywhere without passing multiple speed cameras people actually slow especially paired real attempts collect eg vastly expanded booting operations andor undoing councils recent decision let people multiple outstanding speeding tickets keep renewing licenses registrationsi think help yes think help actually transform citys infrastructure much less carfriendly need sort expansive enforcement regime status quo unacceptable one cant wait move area cause traffic people slowing one time avoid removed yes cameras randomly move mobile people thought camera could literally anywhere drive safer short answer long answer worst drivers country need start using lot strategies get control car insurance prices insane driving since teen never gotten even one speed camera ticket possible drive speed limit could get rid speed cameras made reasonable choice ban cars think congress likes set amount pull fromedit let way fines foreign diplomats family members plus wealth doesnt even spread around areas evenly maybe enforced payment fucking hate speed cameras take money poor make city saferespecially see many cars repeat offenders never pay tickets anyways wont matter hires people tow cars excess traffic violations mdva inforce fines traffic cams good safety tool used work road safety putting everywhere cash grab increase safety seem mostly put catch someone money well seeing drivers city nearly run pedestrians every day crosswalks think cars really slow fuck literally almost hit every fucking day driver making rightonred turn aggressiveness drivers unmatched cities size cameras ineffective one complain new ones council loves helping asshole careless law breakers council effectively made unnecessary pay camera infractionscan expound please mean agree theyre make safer theyre make money rideshare day told driver speed camera coming driver said wasnt big deal md plates mentioned speeding tickets minor infractions reciprocity therefore nothing compelling pay well ya get booted sub filled pictures people getting booted lately assumed upping game regard though ticketing actual residence military road camera bottom hill instead top school actually k street cam joke pedestrians even allowed get money goes towards general fund elaborate wondering tripling cameras actually make things safer traffic enforcement racist many traffic stops end deadly result look happened akron another innocent man dead speeding look stats far people die traffic enforcement pedestrians getting hit mostly true god forbid go mph connecticut ave drove everyday reverse commute two years got two tickets empty lane road mph shameless money grab put camera every street corner justify name public safety like china american apple pie traffic safety didnt car almost years living bike ton around city walk lot well cant even tell number times seen people blow red lightsbut said think traffic camera system problematicnfor several reasons revenue goes general fund rather improvemenrs traffic infrastucuture sure maybe spent traffic safety improvements really traffic safety theyd spending lot md va drivers face consequences getting tickets theyre vast majority reckless drivers theyre indiscriminate received going area wide roads one streets seems excessively punitive speed either careful driver still get tickets year almost every time mph couldnt hit every time tried think fuckery going fault momentary loss focus speed limits go across city cams bottom steep hills one kenilworth right next highway onoff ramps around schools pedestrian walkways fine set make money safety definitely one reason looking forward leaving city succinct true stats thank actual stats ok pretty epic love leaders ignore big problems increase tax revenues areas really seen problem go politics ya thats really point isnt gov focusing things actually make safer intead things make money used waze drove across states didnt hear one traffic cam ahead hit dmv happened every minutes like joke sitcom people probably dislike shitty post dcs streets dangerous avoid speeding ticket drive posted speed limit upvote agree cameras another way tax residents tackle larger issues thats subreddit anti car regardless argument heard mass ave years fimished agree probably effective put speed bumps everywhere cut outs bumps buses people might get sick bumps start take bus metro instead average driver spends hours year traffic hours yearhttpswwwgilmanbedigiancomcarcrashfactsstatisticsindc hahahaha huh always pay even though live md know one day come back haunt take care depends mean effective effective mean making roads safer effective mean making money gov repercussions paying traffic camera tickets average law abiding citizen negatively affected current city council policies yeah dcs case definitely revenue generating shame theres good data showing implemented correctly passive enforcement reduce accidents unsafe driving however requires judicious placement cameras actual enforcement mechanism repeat offendersdc places cameras theyre likely catch people speeding necessarily spots enforcement really needed example near house theres camera bottom hill four lane thoroughfare technically residential houses design street encourages people drive posted speed limit placement camera bottom steep slope makes likely people going speed pass camera theres another camera access road inexplicable reason mph speed markings extremely unclear design road encourages speeding really area enforcement badly needed cameras feel like traps sure generate tons revenue city theyre near pedestrian heavy areas schools likecouple lack enforcement reciprocity md va requirement pay violations renew license collections due tickets barely booting towing theres virtually incentive pay attention cameras sure maaaaybe youll get towed pretty unlikely people regularly wrack k worth tickets face consequences like said feels like city playing numbers game blast tons tickets even small percentage pay big money people pay arent regular repeat offenders op yes always plan speed cameras city really cared make changes roadways like narrowing creating bump outs speed humps creating pedonly streets etc speed cameras purely band aid preferred band aid city line pockets whilst signing multi million dollar contracts camera installation maintenance companies minor infractions words get ticket unless going mph speed limit outstanding tickets md va bootable vehicles two states boot crews getting day residents number people getting rounding error know right plus naturally going faster little decline road absolute joke people stupid theres pedestrians either end tunnel excuses people

camerabased tickets guessing op means lack enforcement makes likely ignore red lights speed limits probably heard loophole drivers maryland virginia pay penalties speed redlight cameras three areas havent come reciprocity deal ujamesda beat think bounty system booting team crowd source leads locations cars highest amount unpaid tickets prioritize flagrant offenders see cars driving slower around speeding cameras slower speeds collisions become less deadly seems pretty conclusive money grab thats mrs bowser good personal wealth went first term guess reelection made wonder could district guess step right direction bandaids one argument cameras penalize speeding without police interactions consider connecticut avenue live connecticut avenue close fellow shouldnt driving lost control suv killed two women trying lunch unseasonably warm winter day connecticut avenue six lane road primarily passes apartments condominiums small commercial strips often clogged personal commercial traffic including many delivery vehicles small giant transit buses features signaled nonsignaled intersections crosswalks every hundred feet goodness even forgot bicyclists construction projects know thirty miles per hour seems reasonable happier camera didnt kick like draw line reasonable speed reasonable speed miles hour happens speeding car connecticut ave hypothetically driver loses control mph goes flying restaurant ground level apartment condo happened driver mph math assuming drove commute five times week weeks year took vacation holidays etc rounded means ticket avoidance rate sounds pretty good ever walk children bike stuff outside car dcspeeding terror killsmaims people got stop theres already cameras street corners city want cheese whine live city never one streets fine supposed punitive literally punishment proposing increase speed limits night despite significantly lower visibility intoxicated drivers speed either careful driverokbut still get tickets year eachhmmm yesand almost every time mph sir speeding downvotes people like cameras think money could allocated things actually make difference please feel insecure opinion think need hurl insults get across let stand got great points think ignoring point post though getting speeding tickets speeding cameras fines city admission streets still dangerous tripling number cameras like say streets arent safer elected officials focusing something doesnt make streets safer awe thanks back post link says much fewer traffic deaths neighbors whut resident ignores tickets cameras zero repercussions making sure understand correctly thats part like people k much less k speeding tickets business driving need get tougher recklessness let time people irresponsible likely catch people speeding literally means likely catch people breaking law boots use parking violationsred light speed camera violations teeth assessment points driving records reason camera violations issued vehicle registration tag drivers license cars brakes deleted drive dangerously slow avoid camera addition comment dumb comes rude fuck oh ya figured closing loophole adding lot enforcement seeing posts drivers getting booted talking connecticut ave cameras well north friendship heights circle east west highway theres literally zero foot traffic one school crossing guard traffic light lets honest che chase kids walk school intersections straight line empty yet speed camera shameless money grab almost bad military road camera st johnsedit guess real gripe isnt speed camera speed limit slow road built using camera actually get enforcement arbitrary speed limit road must altered match speed limit punishing people traveling safe speed higher posted number address bikeratv gangs even stop red lights think bigger issues deal ah ok thanks letting know worth conversing constructively silly say never one streets sincerely believe theres people cars every street every hour isnt nyc driven miles last months mostly hours snd biked thousands miles around city hours pretty good sense traffic patterns theres often totally empty streets middle night weeknights especially residential areasand get meant punitive could still scale like warning st offense lower speeds higher fines running reds etcno one risk going th street tuesday yes people love paying money governments less results actually crazy psychological phenomena yeah great points doesnt ticket reciprocity automated enforcement tickets issues irrelevant people like mad required go speed limit thats thing upset yes correct congress law passed think signed mayor yet still renew license unpaid tickets think potential penalty car booted technically could booted towed owe certain amount however towing team small pretty uncommon people even people k worth tickets get towedbut city wont send delinquents collections theres points system renew license even got lots unpaid tickets id honestly ok law limited nonmoving violations buuuut easier pander idiots want pay speeding tickets worry people dying road way care enforcement law sure creating silly speed traps catch people technically violation law great id argue four lane mph residential thoroughfare fundamentally flawed concept speeding camera cant possibly fix id argue service road dog shit signage forces people exiting highway slow mph mph feet similarly flawed wont fixed traffic camera furthermore neither areas particularly dangerous trafficwise id question problem city even trying address placing cameras therecouple fact areas automated enforcement could actually make safer near parks schools pedestrianbike thoroughfares etc arent targeted city enforcement probably wouldnt generate huge number tickets really didnt removed yeah imagine audacity city make drivers travel mph dense urban area encountering multiple crosswalks believe let selfish assholes like bomb neighborhood total disregard pedestrian safety wtf dangerously slow posted speed limit maybe confused isnt maryland capable constructive conversation communicated nonsense name public safety like china reason people ranting militant cyclists wars cars drivers arent worth time see one people like engage conversation ill oblige cameras ridiculously low speeds create extremely dangerous conditions get half drivers going avoid ticket road appropriate speed probably half going posted speed limit creates danger involved safety wouldnt use cameras create danger money people justifiably upset diplomatic immunity forgiving politicians big reason keep taxing people live work imo recoup ton lost funds never get back places like russiaalso council mayor decide budget go potus congress decide think best two things together think make city always thinking adding budget helps come residents many others skating costs roads got ta paved gotcha thanks weve gotten confused parking tickets people drive like maniacs nerve complain insurance area high removed yeah cam expressway pedestrians allowed want put speeding cams near pedestrian areas go putting highways safe speed posted speed limit knowingly creating dangerous conditions great question large body traffic science revolves around popular idea traffic science called th percentile rule use someone elses words institute transportation engineers defines speed percent vehicles travel words speed limit roads set freeflowing traffic speed around

driving speed limit inherently dangerous saying speed limits well design limits streetroad inherently dangerous perfect world people never exceed limit even dangerously slow limit basing traffic policy logic everyone follow rules one ever ever exceed speed limit dumb encourages pedestrian deaths opinion pedestrian deathsaccidents bad encourage policy limits pedestrian deaths instead

philly one populated cities country million people completely different scale perhaps still downtown though bit nonetheless big deal weird example agree crunchy philly pizza wise may great slice shop every neighborhood ton good optionsi think consistency price best pizza pretty good need know get good pizza pay quality really good though didnt arbitrarily decide anything op asked living specifically dmvnova area compared philly responding ops question mean philly might twice big isnt something consider small crime rate wise cities almost identical though think dcs bit higher way always compare neighborhoods similarity someone asks ward like troubled parts north philly ward like sw philly ward like southern part north philly ward west philly ward ne philly ward nw philly ward center city ward south philly one major difference though except black people everyone else seems transplant whilst philly real ass locals id rather mine bit crunchy mushy doughey personal preference

baltimore maybe enjoy hanging northeast part city grew nonchicago great lakes city besides taking occasional day trip baltimore brookland nearby neighborhoods definitely feel homelike version real city add georgia ave corridor maryland silver springwheaton like olney well post makes wonder degree perceptions cities influenced state mind beforewhile moving example sf first city moved leaving small hometown love everything rose colored glasses effect visit doesnt hit nearly way moving london arguably downgrade lot ways say someone loves wonder subconsciously affecting feelings living many cities feel like rorschach tests reflect aspects back us maybe match wonder sentiment feeling soulless missing factor despite abundance cultural institutions diversity landscapes etc relatively small city huge amount tourism much culture feels like us think invest much cities live personally like many people make city live core identity say someone loved lived decade left definitely big part identityto certain degree though city make network routines home etc pretty livable insofar walkable easy enough get around lots etc make job love network social connections really love anywhereedit point really invest things social connections home routines bring joy likely love anywhere else move back baltimore move philly cool everybody likes every place took good year really love part problem first place lived mega apartment complex falls church even though spending hours day wasnt really able fully immerse moved dupont later petworth everything changed plus lots people know moved new cities pandemic harder time getting know themalso say feels flat like hollywood city set ever read history political aspects communities people outsideofcapitolhill stuff theres rich culture new husband used pick new random neighborhood read explore weekend book point culturally significant spots made appreciate city apart nations capital new city love man nothing ever replace energy gave course could totally ok philly baltimore great living city still hasnt bounced back anywhere close pandemic thats going true every major city right takes years cultural heart city recover sounds like depression problem city problem went boston college wish done therapy wouldnt prevented coming home college work niche part field struggled less college large parts populated largely young people bring money city wont staying long leads kind shallowness imo establishments tend profitable areas much neighborhood feel people cater arent going around longthere good spots though mt pleasant favorite neighborhood mine spirits lift every time go isnt london however last year representative offer left come back twice time took find group friends goes show transient city lived london philly among places see mean still visit baltimore go back philly regularly closer feel citywide describing went almost exact situation described move another state say need separate city means probably lot change scenery nice wont bring happiness looking work youll likely start enjoying city always compare happiest moments life typically look back moments mix right people place mindset relate think ill ever love city much loved london think thats fine understandable lived years love think gets bad rap every place everyone thats finehave found group join social groups city found made loads better work related doesnt involve going baralso think lot people realize washington different unfortunately lot stuff racialized offense anyone usually white people complaining character city plenty look

decade similar thoughts kept thinking get better doesnt cut run took years yep depression still love still sure yet grown since moving keep trying keep finding charms museums events get big artists musicals speakeasies friends family love visit capital theres lot like develop love time got found living mehthere decent food fun things city infrastructure chaotic mess hope ever actually fixing

boston different boston like living annandale different dci think general vibe people love people recently college spending first time big city exploring figure leave whatever actually lives people stay usually government complex leads homogeneous culture takes certain mindset last thereim best enjoy pay way much way little compared city like chicago eventually able leave go enjoy living city better supportive interests without sway governmentalso fact ted cruz anything governing life cant vote representatives total bullshit bit opposite guess comes individual preferences end used moved
